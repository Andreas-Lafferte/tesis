A factor analysis on the responses of 468 Dutch union members about appropriate behavior during a strike produces two factors. The first factor reflects a ``solidarity norm'' favoring group solidarity; the second factor reflects a norm about the treatment of defecting colleagues, which we call the ``free-rider-punishment'' norm. Using OLS regression, we show that adherence to these norms significantly affects union members' willingness to strike, controlling for group identification, and past participation in strikes. This article contributes to a deeper understanding of how solidarity and free-rider-punishment affect future participation.},

  abstract = {This article studies the effect of recent labor market reforms on industrial relations in new democracies (1994\textendash 2003). The literature on labor politics posits two channels through which labor market deregulation may relate to industrial conflict. Wage deregulation may lower wage costs, increasing industrial conflict. Employment deregulation, however, can reduce the ability of workers to act collectively. Using methods uniquely suited for panel data analysis, the study reveals a number of important findings. First, whereas labor quiescence went hand in hand with relatively modest increases in earnings in a number of established democracies, modest wage increases are generally linked with more labor militancy in new democracies. Higher wage and employment regulation minimize wage reductions, lowering the incidence of strikes. Finally, wage regulation has the largest effect on aggregate wages and consequently on the incidence of strikes and lockouts.}

While both have pursued reforms to reduce regulation and to increase labor market flexibility, they have used the state apparatus in different ways to achieve these goals. The Right has reformed labor law by obtaining partial support from employers' associations and unions\textemdash the social partners. The Left, by contrast, has relied on decentralized bargaining with the social partners because its political base would not have accepted flexibility-increasing legal reforms. The author examines critical episodes of reform in collective bargaining, unemployment insurance, and employment protection laws to show how the state has intervened in different ways depending on the political identity of the governing coalition.}

  abstract = {Many economic and social surveys are designed as panel studies, which provide important data for describing social changes and testing causal relations between social phenomena. This textbook shows how to manage, describe, and model these kinds of data. It presents models for continuous and categorical dependent variables, focusing either on the level of these variables at different points in time or on their change over time. It covers fixed and random effects models, models for change scores and event history models. All statistical methods are explained in an application-centered style using research examples from scholarly journals, which can be replicated by the reader through data provided on the accompanying website. As all models are compared to each other, it provides valuable assistance with choosing the right model in applied research. The textbook is directed at master and doctoral students as well as applied researchers in the social sciences, psychology, business administration and economics. Readers should be familiar with linear regression and have a good understanding of ordinary least squares estimation.\hspace{0pt}},

  abstract = {Despite a strengthening of collective labor rights in Latin America over the last 15 years, most labor movements in the region have lost power because neither the content nor the enforcement mechanisms associated with the labor reforms fully took into consideration the challenges presented by economic restructuring. Reforms facilitating union formation did not strengthen unions but instead increased union fragmentation. Collective bargaining structures did not respond to the exigencies of international outsourcing; and the initial round of reforms in the 1990s did not contemplate the need to strengthen labor law enforcement mechanisms at a time when heightened international competition created a need for greater state vigilance of labor standards. Recent reforms or proposed reforms hold more promise for labor, but truly union-friendly labor relations regimes require deeper changes. A review of several Latin American cases is followed by a closer examination of Brazil and El Salvador.}

  abstract = {In recent years sociological research on labour in Argentina has re-flourished. This revival has seen a turn towards the Anglo-Saxon and international traditions of workplace and trade union studies, but it has been generally one-sided, focusing on the relatively successful experiences of trade unions' organized workers in formal sector workplaces. This has represented a considerable departure from the pre-2001 crisis research's agenda that focused on unemployment, poverty and the new forms of community based organizations generated by workers in non-work situations. The return to the institutionalized sphere in the analysis of work issues can be partially explained by the changes in the economic and political environment alongside the return to `normality' of the capital\textendash labour relationship. However, it also signals a tendency in labour studies, in Argentina and beyond, of using the union form as the main organizational frame of reference in the analyses of conflict and workers' representation.},

Comparing the extent of government involvement and the policy scope of social pacts, the chapter measures variation in the degree to which these countries relied on concertation as a mechanism of economic adjustment. The analysis of the necessary and sufficient conditions for pacts helps answer two key questions: why were pacts struck in some countries but not others; and second, is there more than one causal pathway behind these concerted agreements? The analysis reveals three pathways to pacts and demonstrates that a high economic problem load generates pacts only when combined with particular political and institutional conditions, namely the prevalence of electorally weak governments and moderately strong unions.},

The aim is to understand the outcomes of negotiations. The chapter presents a heuristic model of pact creation that incorporates the concepts of bounded rationality and unstable preferences within a standard bargaining framework. Its central argument is that the outcome of pact negotiations depends primarily on actors' perceptions of their relative power. The chapter identifies key indicators influencing these perceptions, and it outlines the main predictions of negotiation outcomes. The model suggests that where power disparities are visible but not excessively large, negotiations are likely to result in pacts. By contrast, where both leading negotiating parties believe that their respective position is strong (or alternatively weak), negotiations have a higher chance of failure.},

Based on an econometric analysis of the determinants of wage moderation in sixteen industrialized countries between 1974 and 2000, it argues that the organizational characteristics of trade unions have a significant impact on wage dynamics. Controlling for a number of institutional and economic factors, the countries in which trade union confederations directly involve workers in the process of collective bargaining ratification have on average lower wage growth relative to productivity than others. The authors also find that collective bargaining coordination and contract ratification magnify each other's wage-dampening effect. Through case studies of Ireland and Italy, the article examines the causal mechanisms underlying the uncovered statistical regularities and concludes that, particularly at a time in which classic political exchange is waning, worker involvement in contract ratification allows confederation leaders to resolve conflicting claims inside their organizations at lower wage levels than are achieved by a less participatory governance process.},

In contrast to current comparative political economy scholarship, which emphasizes the resilience of national institutions to common challenges and trends, it argues that despite a surface resilience of distinct national sets, all countries have been transformed in a neoliberal direction. Neoliberal transformation manifests itself not just as institutional deregulation but also as institutional conversion, as the functions associated with existing institutional forms change in a convergent direction. A key example is the institution of centralized bargaining, once the linchpin of an alternative, redistributive and egalitarian, model of negotiated capitalism, which has been reshaped in the past twenty years to fit the common imperative of liberalization.},

The book offers a comprehensive description and analysis of what has happened to the institutions that regulate the labor market, as well as the relations between employers, unions, and states in Western Europe since the collapse of the long postwar boom. The primary theoretical goal of this book is to provide a critical examination of some of the central claims of comparative political economy, particularly those involving the role and resilience of national institutions in regulating and managing capitalist political economies.},

At the structural level, social ties from non-profit foundations, cultural organizations, university boards, policy planning organizations, and private social clubs add unique ties to those established by interlocking directorates. In addition, the multiple configurations of these social affiliations increase the centrality and reduce the social distance among the corporate directors. Although visualizations of these social networks underscore the changing roles these extra-corporate ties play in uniting corporate directors, they cannot precisely capture the unique effects of ties created by social affiliations outside the boardroom. Utilizing the concepts of structural redundancy and multiplicity, the paper describes the unique contribution each set of ties makes in constructing the social mosaic of corporate America during the second half of the 20th century. The results indicate a dramatic reduction in the role private clubs play in supplementing corporate ties, and an equally significant rise in the importance of social ties generated by policy planning organizations.},

This gave the impression that she would create a favorable climate for social actors such as the Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (Unitary Workers' Federation\textendash CUT) to participate in the policy-making process. Instead, while the government treated the federation as labor's representative both for negotiating the minimum wage and for reaching agreements in important labor conflicts, these gains took place in a context in which the federation's action served the government's interests. In contrast to the situation under previous Concertaci\'on governments, the federation, like most social actors, was only allowed to express its points of view before the advisory commissions of technocrats that were entrusted with the responsibility of making policy. Paradoxically, however, the outcome was more favorable for its interests because of the disposition, at least discursively, of Bachelet's government to move forward on matters that the CUT had long considered ``pending issues.''Como candidata, Michelle Bachelet acert\'o que el suyo ser\'ia un gobierno ciudadano. Esto dio la impresi\'on de que crear\'ia un clima favorable para los actores sociales como la Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT) para que participen en el proceso de la toma de decisiones. En vez, mientras el gobierno trataba con la federaci\'on como representante laboral en negociaciones sobre el salario m\'inimo y en acuerdos en importantes conflictos laborales, estos avances tomaron lugar en un contexto en donde las acciones de la federaci\'on serv\'ian al inter\'es del gobierno. Contrast\'andose con la situaci\'on en previos gobiernos concertacionistas, la federaci\'on, a igual que otros actores sociales, solo se le permit\'ia expresar sus puntos frente comisiones de asesoro en donde se confiaba la responsabilidad en la toma de decisiones a los tecn\'ocratas. Parad\'ojicamente y sin embargo el resultado fue mas favorable a sus intereses por causa de la disposici\'on, por lo menos divagadora, del gobierno de Bachelet en avanzar en materia que la CUT hab\'ia considerado por largo tiempo como ``asuntos pendientes.''}

  abstract = {This article explains cases of business collective action centered on the chief executive officer-based big business organization, the Business Council of Australia (BCA). The paper goes beyond Olsonian accounts of collective action by partly adopting and partly critiquing extant theoretical accounts that deal specifically with business collective action. Following Andrew Pblsky and others, it is found that business collective action is likely to be fostered only if a "daunting" set of conditions is in place, including the motivating role of perceived threats and opportunities, the effective discursive framing of issues and options, and the impetus provided by political entrepreneurs. The often critical role assigned to state elites in much of the extant literature in mobilizing business is criticized. In this Australian case the collective action centering on the BCA was primarily driven by business. Only later was such mobilization supported by state actors. In other words, the initial causal arrows run from business, not the state. A number of factors are found to have driven this business-centric dynamic. These include the role played by business political entrepreneurs, the impact of organizational conditions within the BCA, and wider ideological characteristics, especially the entrenched liberal character of business culture in Australia.}

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models' capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a `hybrid' model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions\textemdash notably random slopes\textemdash we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

The level of public mobilization was exceptionally high (about 25 percent participation rate) and the protests did not stop until they had brought down the ruling government of Iceland. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this volume situates the protest in historical-cultural context and applies social movement theory to explore how the economic crisis ended up triggering the protests, thus providing a step toward understanding why the global financial crisis has triggered public unrest in other countries.},

The antigovernment protests that occurred in several European countries in the aftermath of the global financial crisis brought crises to the forefront of collective action research in democratic societies, as well as provide important opportunities for studying how crises can trigger large-scale collective action. This volume focusses on Iceland's 'Pots and Pans Revolution', a series of large scale antigovernment protests and riots that took place in Iceland in autumn 2008 and January 2009. The Icelandic case offers a rare opportunity to study processes that can trigger political protest in an affluent, democratic society. The protests took place in the aftermath of a national financial collapse triggered by the global financial crisis in early October 2008. While having almost no tradition of mass protest, Iceland was among the first countries to respond to the global crisis with large-scale protest. The level of public mobilization was exceptionally high (about 25 percent participation rate) and the protests did not stop until they had brought down the ruling government of Iceland. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this volume situates the protest in historical-cultural context and applies social movement theory to explore how the economic crisis ended up triggering the protests, thus providing a step toward understanding why the global financial crisis has triggered public unrest in other countries.},

Boolean analysis demonstrates the improbable nature of the social pacts negotiated in Spain; subsequent analysis aims at improving our understanding of why Spain successed. While social pacts have been minimally useful in most new democracies, inflation has been combatted more successfully in many countries (including some of the cases analyzed here) via the move from state capitalism toward more free-market policies. While market economics has been more successful in fighting inflation, the political effects of such policies have been mixed.}

Of the five groups of variables suggested by the extant PAC literature\textendash availability of resources, free rider problems, material interests, previous campaign activity, and industry categories\textendash just the measures of material interests have consistent and important effects on the level of firm political activity. Firms with the richest history of interaction with the state, top defense contractors, major acquirers of other businesses, and corporations prosecuted for criminal acts are the most politically active of large firms. Thus, while material interests are an important determinant of political action, this study suggests only interests tied to special long-term relationships with the state serve to increase the amount of political action taken by large firms. These results suggest that the pluralist-based theory of business political involvement, so widely accepted among contemporary PAC researchers, is of little utility for explaining firm differences in political activity.}

Key to their successful use is having IVs that are uncorrelated with an equation's disturbance and that are sufficiently strongly related to the problematic endogenous covariates. This review briefly defines IVs, summarizes their origins, and describes their use in multiple regression, simultaneous equation models, factor analysis, latent variable structural equation models, and limited dependent variable models. It defines and contrasts three methods of selecting IVs: auxiliary instrumental variable, model implied instrumental variable, and randomized instrumental variable. It provides overidentification tests and weak IV diagnostics as methods to evaluate the quality of IVs. I review the use of IVs in models that assume heterogeneous causal effects. Another section summarizes the use of IVs in contemporary sociological publications. The conclusion suggests ways to improve the use of IVs and suggests that there are many areas in which IVs could be profitably used in sociological research.},

Addresses the question of whether the contemporary workplace is characterized by management practices which might be termed post-Fordist, involving an extension of employee discretion and autonomy, or whether traditional practices of direct hierarchical control are more in evidence. Data suggests that the latter practices are more likely to prevail in all of the countries examined despite assertions in the literature that new, more flexible work arrangements are transforming the old methods of production. Concludes with an evaluation of the opportunities which exist for the empowerment of trade union members at the workplace level under these circumstances.},

  abstract = {We investigate the regulation of labor markets through employment, collective relations, and social security laws in 85 countries. We find that the political power of the left is associated with more stringent labor regulations and more generous social security systems, and that socialist, French, and Scandinavian legal origin countries have sharply higher levels of labor regulation than do common law countries. However, the effects of legal origins are larger, and explain more of the variation in regulations, than those of politics. Heavier regulation of labor is associated with lower labor force participation and higher unemployment, especially of the young. These results are most naturally consistent with legal theories, according to which countries have pervasive regulatory styles inherited from the transplantation of legal systems.}

The resources considered are time, money, and civic skills\textendash those communications and organizational capacities that are essential to political activity. These skills are not only acquired early in life but developed in the nonpolitical institutional settings of adult life: the workplace, organizations, and churches and synagogues. These resources are distributed differentially among groups defined by socioeconomic status. A two-stage least squares analysis shows these resources have powerful effects on overall political activity, thus explaining why socioeconomic status has traditionally been so powerful in predicting participation. We disaggregate overall activity into three kinds of acts: those that involve giving time, those that entail donating money, and voting. Each requires a different configuration of resources resulting in different patterns of stratification across various political acts.}

The results show that institutional change impairs the capacity to moderate unit labour cost growth significantly in the subsequent years following the change. This effect also holds for changes in both decentralization and centralization of institutions.},

Using data on political contributions by U. S. corporations and corporate elites between 1956 and 1982, we find little evidence of such a split within the capitalist class. During this period corporate elites exhibited a strong preference for conservative candidates, with little variation along the dimensions emphasized by corporate liberalism theory. Support for a rightward shift in U. S. state policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s was as equal, if not greater, among segments of the capitalist class that corporate liberalism theory labels as "liberal" as among those that it labels as "conservative." Whatever validity this theory of class segments may have had in earlier years, it provides a very poor map of political cleavages within the capitalist class during the last quarter century.}

Using quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression, the author shows that social ties formed through common membership on corporate boards contribute more to similarity of political behavior than commonalities of economic interests, such as those associated with operating in the same industry or the same geographic region. Moreover, the politically cohesive effects of directorship ties remain robust even as one moves several links down the chain of indirect ties that connect top corporate officers to one another. The study thus provides empirical support for the thesis that social networks among corporate elites facilitate political cohesion within the business community.}

Most of the literature analyzing demand for redistribution has focused on objective inequality, rather than subjective perceptions of inequality. However, a model that links demand for redistribution to subjective inequality is needed given that recent empirical research has shown a growing gap between subjective and objective inequality. Using data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) survey on social inequality we focus on explaining individuals' formation of perceptions using objective variables and we then study the relationship between individuals' perceptions of equality and their demand for redistribution. We find that objective macro variables are associated to individual perceptions, and that individual circumstances like age, educational attainment, and employment status play also a role. Perceptions of equality, in turn, are significatively correlated to demand for redistribution and seem to substitute for any effect of objective variables. This result suggests that contextual, macro variables only affect individuals' demand for redistribution through their perceptions of equality and don't have a direct effect.}

  abstract = {The structure of labour markets is increasingly perceived as a determinant of the macroeconomic performance of a country. This article focuses on one aspect of labour markets, the degree of centralization of wage setting. The main conclusion is that extremes work best. Either highly centralized systems with national bargaining (such as in Austria and the Nordic countries), or highly decentralized systems with wage setting at the level of individual firms (such as in Japan, Switzerland and the US) seem to perform well. The worst outcomes with respect to employment may well be found in systems with an intermediate degree of centralization (such as in Belgium and the Netherlands). This conclusion is reasonably well supported by the available empirical evidence. It is also logical. Indeed, large and all-encompassing trade unions naturally recognize their market power and take into account both the inflationary and unemployment effects of wage increases. Conversely, unions operating at the individual firm or plant level have very limited market power. In intermediate cases, unions can exert some market power but are led to ignore the macroeconomic implications of their actions. These conclusions challenge the conventional wisdom which asserts that the more 'corporatist' is an economy, the better is its economic performance.}

Manufacturers mobilized in Morocco but remained politically dormant in Tunisia in response to nearly identical incentives and challenges from global markets. New economic conditions created cleavages in the business class in both countries, but these cleavages were only politicized to the extent that producer groups mobilized. The ability to generate a cohesive class identity, which arose in response to perceived threats from other producer factions, was critical for successful business collective action. These findings call into question key assumptions in theories of collective action and introduce a new approach to globalization and domestic politics.}

I use a maximum likelihood framework that provides a way to estimate distributions, evaluate model fit, and also test against alternative distributions. I consider a few theories that can create power law distributions in strike size, such as the joint costs model that posits strike size is inversely proportional to dispute costs. I find that the power law distribution fits the data for the number of lost person calendar days relatively well and is also more appropriate than the lognormal distribution. I also discuss the implications of my findings from a methodological, research, and policy perspective.}

In this paper, college students' historical representations of their nation's origin are studied. We compared specific quantitative answers about who the first inhabitants of Argentina were with more in depth qualitative answers about their nation's political origin. In this respect, a conflict has been found in the way students present the official narrative. This conflict consists of maintaining that natives were the first national inhabitants, while most of the students think their nation was created in the 19th century. Different reactions to this are analyzed, particularly students' efforts to justify this conflict and to find coherency in historical content which has been produced by school history teaching and other sources and consumed by college students. The most common justifications include cultural tools that conceal the violence historically suffered by the natives, and at the same time an unreal conciliation between natives' rights and the interests of western founders of the national state. These tensions are considered in light of sociocultural discussions about the differences between production and consumption of historical narratives and their appropriation. We uphold that consumed historical narratives are based on an ontological and ahistorical concept of one's own nation, which prevents understanding a possible counternarrative based on natives as historical agents.},

The present study suggests that in addition to resources, an individual's beliefs about economic distribution are an important determinant of participation both in elections and in protests. Based on the analysis of the Chilean data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) 2012, the results suggest that distributive beliefs are associated primarily with participation in protests.}

  abstract = {Economic inequality is usually assumed to be a threat to social cohesion and democracy. Nevertheless, this opposition of inequality and democracy is based on further assumptions such as (a) that people perceive economic inequality accurately, and (b) that, by and large they consider inequality unjust. Research into distributive issues has not found consistent support for neither of these assumptions. Quite the contrary, empirical evidence indicates that economic inequality is widely misperceived and that inequality is to some extent considered legitimate. So far most of the empirical evidence in the area of legitimacy comes from experimental studies in the developed world. The present research aims at widening the scope of legitimacy studies by focusing on Chile as a case country, one of the societies with the highest economic inequality worldwide, guided by the question to what extent is economic inequality considered legitimate in a context of high economic inequality? In addressing this question, and based on previous evidence, the article proposes a way to evaluate (a) the legitimacy of inequality at a country level via survey research, and (b) the role of inequality perception and justice ideologies in the justification of economic inequality. The data to be analyzed is the public opinion survey International Social Justice Project (ISJP), implemented in Chile in the year 2007 (n = 890). Multivariate analysis results reveal signs of legitimacy of inequality in Chile, opening a series of issues regarding the acceptance and stability of unequal distributions.}

Unions offer not only wage bargaining strength, but also protection against uninsurable labour market risks, and similar protection may also be offered by labour market institutions. Empirically, such institutions as job security legislation and wage indexation do appear to crowd out unions. Conversely, institutional features that make it easier for unions to function (such as workplace representation and centralized wage bargaining) are empirically associated with higher unionization.}

  abstract = {U.S. corporations have shared members of their boards of directors since the early 1900s, creating a dense interlock network in which nearly every major corporation was connected through short paths and elevating a handful of well-connected directors to an influential ``inner circle.'' This network remained highly connected throughout the 20th century, serving as a mechanism for the rapid diffusion of information and practices and promoting elite cohesion. Some of the most well-established findings in the sociology of networks sprang from this milieu. In the 2000s, however, board recruiting practices changed: the authors find that well-connected directors became less preferred. As a result, the inner circle disappeared and companies became less connected to each other. Revisiting three classic studies, on the diffusion of corporate policies, on corporate executives' political unity, and on elite socialization, shows that established understandings of the effects of board interlocks on U.S. corporations, directors, and social elites no longer hold.}

  abstract = {Several studies have recently found that world income inequality declined during the closing years of the twentieth century. However, these studies feature a number of shortcomings, including the use of outdated national income estimates to measure inequality between countries, as well as sparse data to capture the smaller (but growing) component found within countries. The current study addresses these concerns and offers new estimates of world income inequality based on 151 countries covering 95 percent of the world's population during the 1990-2008 period. Overall, the results are fairly compatible with prior efforts, lending greater confidence to earlier findings. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prior studies covering the 1990s overestimate the decline in between-country inequality, but underestimate the rise in within-country inequality. Consequently, total inequality did not begin to decline substantially until the post-2000 era. After presenting these estimates, I then examine factors associated with income mobility among the 15,100 subnational percentile groups in my data set. The results suggest that (a) the negative effect of inequality is larger than the positive effect of economic growth among the poorest 25 percent of the world's population, and (b) late industrialization has contributed to income convergence between countries, while economic globalization has primarily served to stretch income distributions within nations.},

  abstract = {New forms of social stratification are emerging. Much of our thinking about stratification - from Marx, Weber, and others - must be recast to capture these new developments. Social class was the key theme of past stratification work. Yet class is an increasingly outmoded concept. Class stratification implies that people can be differentiated hierarchically on one or more criteria into distinct layers, classes. Class analysis has grown increasingly inadequate in recent decades as traditional hierarchies have declined and new social differences have emerged. The cumulative impact of these changes is fundamentally altering the nature of social stratification - placing past theories in need of substantial modification. This paper outlines first some general propositions about the sources of class stratification and its decline. The decline of hierarchy, and its spread across situses, is emphasised. The general propositions are applied to political parties and ideological cleavages, the economy, the family, and social mobility. These developments appear most clearly in North America and Western Europe, but our propositions also help interpret some of the tensions and factors driving change in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and other societies.},

I argue that, despite a by-now voluminous literature, not enough attention has been paid to the social context of income inequality \DH{} health relationships or to the causes of income inequality itself. In this paper I contend that there is a particular anity between neo-liberal (market-oriented) political doctrines, income inequality and lowered social cohesion.

The rise of neo-liberalism and the decline of the welfare state are themselves tied to globalization and the changing class structures of the advanced capitalist societies.

  abstract = {The concept of "corporatism" has usefully called attention to the importance of systems of interest representation based on non-competing groups that are officially sanctioned, subsidized, and supervised by the state. Yet these patterns have appeared in such a remarkable variety of political contexts that this concept may be too broad to be useful. On the basis of an analysis of the relationship between the state and organized labor in Latin America, this article argues that the concept of corporatism can be disaggregated so that it sheds light on rather than obscures the different power relationships and political contexts with which it is associated. The analysis focuses on the distinction between "inducements" extended by the state to win the cooperation of groups and "constraints" through which the state directly controls groups. This disaggregated approach enables one to distinguish more subtly among systems of group representation, to conceive of state-group relations in more interactive terms, and to gain insights into the larger political context.}

Although scholars have studied variation among left regimes and how these regimes differ from neoliberal-era predecessors, few have addressed the role of labour unions and labour policy under the Left. We argue that `bringing unions back in' to the analysis of left governments' performance sharpens distinctions with neoliberal governments and unsettles existing typologies. We review the labour policies of left governments in four countries\textemdash Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina\textemdash to show how a labour lens enriches our understanding of left governments in the region.}

For older voters, turnout exceeded, on average, 90 percent in 2009; for those aged less than 30, it fell below 30 percent. Using individual survey data from 2006, 2008, and 2010, this article studies the current socioeconomic composition of the Chilean young electorate. First, it shows that the young electorate is class-biased. Income is highly correlated with both registration and turnout even after controlling for education. Second, it presents evidence that class bias for the whole electorate has been increasing over time, due to generational replacement. The results are not promising for Chile's democracy in the years to come, since equal participation is worsening over time.}

  abstract = {Across Europe, contemporary negotiated reforms of economic and social policy are increasingly characterized by a logic of information rather than a logic of exchange. Unlike in neo-corporatist bargaining over incomes policies, states negotiate with the social partners not primarily to secure their acquiescence, but instead to enlist their active assistance in designing and mobilizing support for substantial reforms of public policy. State policy-makers lack the combination of technical, relational, and local information necessary to design successful blueprints for reform, and so they are dependent on the social partners to acquire this information. In systems in which unions and employers' associations can exercise dialogic capacity, policy innovation is more likely to come from the propositions of the social partners than from political parties or bureaucrats. Using this logic, the article undertakes a pairwise comparison of episodes of negotiated reform: pensions in France and Italy, and vocational training in France and Germany.},

Why have unions not been invited into government buildings to negotiate paths of economic adjustment in the countries hardest hit by the crisis?

  abstract = {This essay highlights productive ways in which scholars have reanimated the concept of structural power to explain puzzles in international and comparative politics. Past comparative scholarship stressed the dependence of the state on holders of capital, but it struggled to reconcile this supposed dependence with the frequent losses of business in political battles. International relation (IR) scholars were attentive to the power of large states, but mainstream IR neglected the ways in which the structure of global capitalism makes large companies international political players in their own right. To promote a unified conversation between international and comparative political economy, structural power is best conceptualized as a set of mutual dependencies between business and the state. A new generation of structural power research is more attentive to how the structure of capitalism creates opportunities for some companies (but not others) vis-\`a-vis the state, and the ways in which that structure creates leverage for some states (but not others) to play off companies against each other. Future research is likely to put agents \textendash{} both states and large firms \textendash{} in the foreground as political actors, rather than showing how the structure of capitalism advantages all business actors in the same way against non-business actors.},

While in broad international comparisons typically no clear-cut link between income inequality and (un)happiness exists, we can demonstrate that Europeans are somewhat less happy in more unequal places. We further discuss and empirically test three explanations as to why Europeans are inequality-averse, namely (dis)trust, status anxiety, and perceived conflicts. Each of these three potential mediators is hypothesized to be shaped by the extent of a nation's income inequality, and in turn to result in lower subjective well-being. A multilevel mediation analysis with data from the European Quality of Life Survey 2007 for 30 countries reveals that distrust and status anxiety are important mediators of inequality aversion, whereas perceived conflict is not. We can further show that trust is the crucial mediator among affluent societies, whereas status anxiety is crucial among the less affluent societies. The results are discussed with reference to the Spirit Level theory developed by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett.}

While in broad international comparisons typically no clear-cut link between income inequality and (un)happiness exists, we can demonstrate that Europeans are somewhat less happy in more unequal places. We further discuss and empirically test three explanations as to why Europeans are inequality-averse, namely (dis)trust, status anxiety, and perceived conflicts. Each of these three potential mediators is hypothesized to be shaped by the extent of a nation's income inequality, and in turn to result in lower subjective well-being. A multilevel mediation analysis with data from the European Quality of Life Survey 2007 for 30 countries reveals that distrust and status anxiety are important mediators of inequality aversion, whereas perceived conflict is not. We can further show that trust is the crucial mediator among affluent societies, whereas status anxiety is crucial among the less affluent societies. The results are discussed with reference to the Spirit Level theory developed by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an enormous increase in protests across the world in which citizens have challenged what they see as a deterioration of democratic institutions and the very civil, political and social rights that form the basis of democratic life. Beginning with Iceland in 2008, and then forcefully in Egypt, Tunisia, Spain, Greece and Portugal, or more recently in Peru, Brazil, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey and Ukraine, people have taken to the streets against what they perceive as a rampant and dangerous corruption of democracy, with a distinct focus on inequality and suffering.This timely new book addresses the anti-austerity social movements of which these protests form part, mobilizing in the context of a crisis of neoliberalism. Donatella della Porta shows that, in order to understand their main facets in terms of social basis, strategy, and identity and organizational structures, we should look at the specific characteristics of the socioeconomic, cultural and political context in which they developed. The result is an important and insightful contribution to understanding a key issue of our times, which will be of interest to students and scholars of political and economic sociology, political science and social movement studies, as well as political activists.},

These countries have diverse experiences with gender politics: some have been leaders in suffrage reforms and equal rights, while, in others, divorce has only recently been legalized. This article examines the relationship between gender and participation in seventeen Latin American countries. Many core results from research in the developed world hold in Latin America as well. Surprisingly, however, there is no evidence that economic development provides an impetus for more equal levels of participation. Instead, the most important contextual factors are civil liberties and women's presence among the visible political elite.}

Research, however, seldom deals with both simultaneously and theirpotentialinterrelations. In thisarticle, we examine the complex relationships between union organization and workersolidarity relative to strikeaction. We draw on a data set of 133 content-coded workplace ethnographies and use a combination of qualitative comparative analysis and more standard statistical techniques. Consistent with expectations, results suggest union presence and worker solidarity, in and of themselves, havelittlemeaningfulassociation with strikes. Rather, it is their co-presence that bolsters strikelikelihood. Conversely, a lack of union presence in combination with a lack of collective mobilization history diminishes overall strike potential. We conclude by discussing the implications ofour argument and findings for more general social movement perspectives as well as prior work dealingspecifically with unions, solidarity, and collective resistance.},

This contribution analyses the potential for trade union renewal, drawing on several examples of organising approaches in the USA and Germany.},

  abstract = {The law regarding collective bargaining in Chile is both underdeveloped and weak, resulting on its coverage being very limited. However, in recent years, figures on collective bargaining coverage in Chile present two interesting developments. On one hand, they reveal a slight and sustained increase since 2006, and on the other hand, they surprise with a considerable increase since 2014. Apparently something has changed or works better in Chile, based on this new data. However, as we will explain in this paper, low coverage and precarious unionism have not ceased to be the general rule for the Chilean case and a decisive factor to take into account is its particular institutional setting. In light of the specificities of the Chilean reality, we propose a calculation mechanism that allows us to better observe the coverage of collective bargaining in the country. The data adjusted by this proposed correction indicate that by 2015 it reaches less than 10\% of wage earners in the private sector. If the average growth in the coverage of collective bargaining in the last 25 years has been maintained, Chile has little chance of getting out of the low level it currently exhibits in this area.},

This article examines the formation and development of theories of class identity over the past century. From a debate largely among Marxists in the early 20th century about the conditions under which the working class will mobilize to defend its interests \textendash{} moving from a ``class in itself'' to a ``class for itself'' \textendash{} the question of the relationship between individuals' class position, social interests, and political mobilization attracted greater attention among social scientists following World War II. However, postwar socioeconomic transformations led some to argue for the ``death of class'' as a central organizing principle for modern social and political life. While others countered that class identities remained relevant, the sharp decline in class-based organization in the late 20th century led scholars to develop more nuanced understandings of the relationship between individuals' class position and collective identities. Although current scholarship shows that there is no natural translation of class identities into collective action, the reality of growing socioeconomic inequality, along with the resurgence of social and political mobilizations to contest that growth, suggests that class identities retain the capacity to unite.},

Labor revitalization in a context of persistent informality raised the following question: Were there union organizing strategies that related formal workers to the broader working class community that included informal workers? This article answered the question through the analysis of union strategies from three formal sector firms located in one city of the Northern Gran Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2005 and 2011. The evidence from this comparison showed that in two of the factories there were union strategies to reach the community. The existence of a grassroots democratic union in the shop floor appeared as a necessary condition for inclusive union strategies. The scale of those relations varied according to the geographical pattern of workers' housing, which was the result of the company's localization strategy.},

  abstract = {Class identity is a key mechanism in the explanation of class-based collective action. For decades, this was particularly relevant in Latin America, where objective class inequality was persistent and there was a long history of collective action, originating in the workplace and expressed through unions and labor parties. Despite persistent inequalities in the region, since the 1990s scholars increasingly claimed that the relation between objective class position and subjective class identification weakened significantly, and that class dynamics centered on work were no longer central to explain group formation and collective action among the popular sectors. While in countries like Argentina scholars have explained these processes by focusing on the effects of the de-industrialization of the economy and the informalization of the job market, in Chile analysts have done so by emphasizing the growth of the service sector and the emergence of a middle-class society where `old-fashioned' working-class identities have become irrelevant. This article questions these arguments based on a comparative analysis of the relationship between objective class position and subjective class identification in Argentina and Chile in 2009. The results show that class still matters. In both countries, people with a working-class position or a working-class trajectory are significantly more likely to uphold working-class identity than individuals with a privileged class position or trajectory. Surprisingly, the authors' analysis also demonstrates that the overall rates of working-class identification are higher in Chile than in Argentina. The authors explain these unexpected results by looking at contemporary class-related phenomena (e.g. higher inequality and economic concentration in Chile) and longer-term class dynamics (particularly differences stemming from the `radical' party\textendash union configuration in Chile and the state-corporatist incorporation of labor in Argentina).},

  abstract = {Class identity is a key mechanism in the explanation of class-based collective action. For decades, this was particularly relevant in Latin America, where objective class inequality was persistent and there was a long history of collective action, originating in the workplace and expressed through unions and labor parties. Despite persistent inequalities in the region, since the 1990s scholars increasingly claimed that the relation between objective class position and subjective class identification weakened significantly, and that class dynamics centered on work were no longer central to explain group formation and collective action among the popular sectors. While in countries like Argentina scholars have explained these processes by focusing on the effects of the de-industrialization of the economy and the informalization of the job market, in Chile analysts have done so by emphasizing the growth of the service sector and the emergence of a middle-class society where `old-fashioned' working-class identities have become irrelevant. This article questions these arguments based on a comparative analysis of the relationship between objective class position and subjective class identification in Argentina and Chile in 2009. The results show that class still matters. In both countries, people with a working-class position or a working-class trajectory are significantly more likely to uphold working-class identity than individuals with a privileged class position or trajectory. Surprisingly, the authors' analysis also demonstrates that the overall rates of working-class identification are higher in Chile than in Argentina. The authors explain these unexpected results by looking at contemporary class-related phenomena (e.g. higher inequality and economic concentration in Chile) and longer-term class dynamics (particularly differences stemming from the `radical' party\textendash{} union configuration in Chile and the state-corporatist incorporation of labor in Argentina).}

  abstract = {Exceptional cases are at odds with the typical: they stand out as bizarre and rare. What then could justify their systematic analysis? Elaborating the analytical distinction between anomalies, exceptions and outliers, this paper outlines three potential epistemic contributions of exceptional cases. First, exceptional cases reveal the limits of standard classification categories. In so doing, they problematize usual classificatory grids. Their input is critical. Second, exceptional cases point to new classes of objects. They acquire paradigmatic status when they exemplify the characteristic features of these new classes with utmost clarity. Third, exceptional cases magnify relational patterns that in more mundane contexts lack visibility. Here their contribution is heuristic. These three contributions become possible when we put at bay normative expectations of what should happen, and specify cases by reference to an analytical space of constitutive dimensions. To underscore the general significance of these observations, I draw on examples borrowed from different quarters of the social sciences: the sociology of organizations, ethnomethodology, comparative historical sociology and the history of science., Les cas exceptionnels apparaissent le plus souvent comme atypiques, bizarres ou rares. D\`es lors comment justifier d'en proposer une analyse syst\'ematique ? \`A partir d'une distinction analytique entre les anomalies, les exceptions et les d\'eviations, cet article met en avant trois contributions \'epist\'emiques des cas exceptionnels. Tout d'abord, les cas exceptionnels r\'ev\`elent les limites des cat\'egories et classifications standards. Ils permettent de probl\'ematiser les grilles classificatoires. Leur apport est critique. Ensuite, les cas exceptionnels permettent d'identifier de nouvelles classes d'objets. Ils acqui\`erent un statut paradigmatique lorsqu'ils manifestent les caract\'eristiques sp\'ecifiques de ces nouvelles classes. Enfin, les cas exceptionnels mettent en \'evidence des mod\`eles relationnels qui dans des contextes plus ordinaires resteraient invisibles. Leur contribution est ici heuristique. Ces trois contributions deviennent possibles lorsque nous suspendons nos attentes normatives par rapport \`a ce qui devrait se passer, et sp\'ecifions les cas en r\'ef\'erence \`a un espace analytique de dimensions constitutives. L'article s'appuie sur des exemples tir\'es principalement des sciences sociales : la sociologie des organisations, l'ethnom\'ethodologie, la sociologie historique comparative et l'histoire des sciences., Au\ss ergew\"ohnliche Situationen werden meist als untypisch, komisch und selten dargestellt. Womit l\"asst sich dann aber ihre systematische Untersuchung rechtfertigen? Ausgehend von der Differenzierung zwischen Abweichungen, Ausnahmen und Sonderf\"allen, hebt dieser Beitrag drei epistemische Beitr\"age au\ss ergew\"ohnlicher F\"alle hervor. Erstens verdeutlichen au\ss ergew\"ohnliche F\"alle die Grenzen von Kategorien und Klassifizierungen. Ihr Beitrag ist kritisch. Zweitens verweisen au\ss ergew\"ohnliche F\"alle auf neue Gegenstandsmodelle. Sie erhalten einen paradigmatischen Rang durch das Aufzeigen spezifischer Charakteristika dieser neuen Modelle. Drittens verdeutlichen au\ss ergew\"ohnliche F\"alle Beziehungsmodelle, die in gew\"ohnlicheren Zusammenh\"angen unsichtbar bleiben. Ihr Beitrag ist hier heuristisch. Diese drei Beitr\"age sind m\"oglich, wenn wir unsere normativen Verhaltensweisen bez\"uglich des Vorhersehbaren aufheben und die F\"alle in Beziehung zu einem analytischen Raum konstitutiver Dimensionen setzen. Der Beitrag fu\ss t haupts\"achlich auf Beispielen aus den Sozialwissenschaften: Organisationssoziologie, Ethnomethodologie, vergleichende Geschichtssoziologie und Wissenschaftsgeschichte.},

Confirming the findings of other studies, this analysis indicates that there is gender segmentation in civic associational activities, and that men are more involved than women in political activities, except for voting. Among those involved in civic activities, however, women attend meetings more often than men or about equally in all types of activities under consideration, except for sports and recreational pursuits. This highlights the need to differentiate between type and intensity of civic participation and provides empirical evidence that Latin American women have strong community ties through a variety of organizations. The regression analysis shows that civic engagement has a positive effect on political participation but that the magnitude of that effect varies by gender depending on the activity.}

The article defines ``segmented neo-corporatism'' as a new form of centralized incomes policy in the region that applies to a substantial portion (i.e., registered workers), though not to all the labor force. Drawing on neo-corporatist theory, I explain, first, why only Argentina and Uruguay could consolidate a centralized, national wage policy in the context of the Latin American Left-Turn. Second, I test empirically the degree of state-oriented wage coordination. The study argues that monetary policy deterrence and higher levels of bargaining centralization largely explain the greater capacity of Uruguayan neo-corporatism to govern wage-setting compared with its Argentine counterpart. Finally, the article puts segmented neo-corporatism in comparative perspective in the developing world and draws some theoretical implications.},

This claim is tested by examining the efSect of varying the social class origins of vignette characters on judgments and explanations concerning their outcomes. Four domains of social activity are examined: occupational attainment, educationa\textbackslash textbackslash textasciitilde achievement, relationship success, and unemployment. In all of these areas, the class background of the characters was found to be associated with different outcome expectations,future expectations,judgments of responsibility and differences in the ways in which outcomes were explained. The results are consistent with the claim that people have cognitive models in which social class background is associated with particular social outcomes across a range of activities, and that these models are reasonably accurate representations of the relationships between social class and life-chances. This suggests that contrary to theories which have stressed the individualistic nature of belief systems in western societies, social classforms an important part of thepopular representation of the influences on occupational, educational and relationship success.}

It shows how the changing shape of the class structure since 1945 has led political parties to change, which has both reduced class voting and increased class non-voting. This argument is developed in three stages. The first is to show that there has been enormous social continuity in class divisions. The authors demonstrate this using extensive evidence on class and educational inequality, perceptions of inequality, identity and awareness, and political attitudes over more than fifty years. The second stage is to show that there has been enormous political change in response to changing class sizes. Party policies, politicians' rhetoric, and the social composition of political elites have radically altered. Parties offer similar policies, appeal less to specific classes, and are populated by people from more similar backgrounds. Simultaneously the mass media have stopped talking about the politics of class. The third stage is to show that these political changes have had three major consequences. First, as Labour and the Conservatives became more similar, class differences in party preferences disappeared. Second, new parties, most notably UKIP, have taken working class voters from the mainstream parties. Third, and most importantly, the lack of choice offered by the mainstream parties has led to a huge increase in class-based abstention from voting.

Argentina has advanced further than Chile in two policy areas: corporate taxation, which taps firmlevel profits; and tax agency access to bank information, which helps reduce income tax evasion. These outcomes are explained by drawing on the classic concepts of business instrumental power, which entails political actions, and structural power, which arises from investment decisions. In Chile, strong instrumental power removed reforms in both areas from the policy agenda. In Argentina, much weaker instrumental power at the cross-sectoral level facilitated corporate tax increases. Bank information access was expanded after Argentina's 2001 crisis weakened the financial sector's instrumental power and reduced structural power.}

  abstract = {Structural power is a critical variable that merits more extensive and more explicit attention in Latin American political economy and in comparative politics more broadly. Assessing structural power in conjunction with its counterpart, instrumental power, can provide strong leverage for explaining variation in policy outcomes that affect business interests. However, structural power must be carefully defined and operationalized in order to capture its core attributes and nuances. This task requires wedding the concept's ``structural'' underpinnings with policymakers' perceptions and anticipated reactions. Moreover, the relationship between structural power and instrumental power must be carefully theorized. While these concepts encompass distinct channels through which business exerts influence, the two types of power may be mutually reinforcing. I argue that business interests shape policy outcomes when either their structural power or their instrumental power is strong, yet business influence will be more extensive and more consistent when structural power and instrumental power are both strong. However, electoral incentives, and more importantly, popular mobilization, can counteract business power. I illustrate these theoretical points with a case study of Chile's 2014 tax reform proposal, a major policy initiative with important distributive consequences that received international press attention.}

  abstract = {Unexpected social policy expansion and progressive tax reforms initiated by right-wing governments in Latin America highlight the need for further theory development on the politics of redistribution. We focus on electoral competition for low-income voters in conjunction with the power of organized actors\textemdash both business and social movements. We argue that electoral competition motivates redistribution under left-wing and right-wing incumbents alike although such initiatives are more modest when conservatives dominate and business is well organized. Social mobilization drives more substantial redistribution by counterbalancing business power and focusing incumbents on securing social peace and surviving in office. By characterizing distinctive features of social-policy politics and tax-policy politics and theorizing linkages between the two realms, we contribute to broader debates on the relative influence of voters versus organized interests in policymaking. We apply our theory to explain ``least-likely'' cases of redistributive policies under conservative governments in Mexico (2000-2012) and Chile (2010-2014).},

The data support Mannheim's theory of distinctive intragenerational units who are agents of social change. In addition, confirmatory factor analysis verified five separate dimensions of political behavior. Civil rights activists scored the highest on four measures of active conventional and unconventional politics. The noninvolved in college politics are the least active as adults. Although both the protesters and the institutional activists are highly involved in politics, they tend to be on opposite sides in various political arenas.}

Contrary to Marxist thought, evidence on the deskilling of working-class occupations is inconclusive. Marxist and non-Marxists agree that management has not succeeded in dictating the control of work. The literature fails to locate connections between technology, work alienation, job dissatisfaction, and the societal alienation of workers. Weakest theory and research deal with the political mobiliza of the working class, which is hampered by its internal stratification and cleavages. Paradoxically, labor unions are more effective in promoting consumer interests than those of their members or other workers.}

Dockworkers' strategic location in the economies of both countries would predict a high degree of shop-floor power among both groups. In practice, however, Colombian dock-workers had far less shop-floor power than their Chilean counterparts, as a result of mitigating social and political factors. Consequently, they developed a strategy this study terms human rights unionism, relying on external allies and lawsuits for leverage, rather than shop-floor action. Dockworkers in Chile, by contrast, adopted a strategy termed class struggle unionism, relying on nationally and internationally coordinated shop-floor action. This article therefore proposes an expanded model of workers' structural power, incorporating the roles of state and society to better account for power differentials and divergent strategic pathways among workers who share a common position in the economic system.},

This question is examined through a study of the International Dockworkers Council (IDC), an exceptional case of institutionalised rank-and-file union democracy at the transnational level. A shadow comparison examines the work of the International Transport Workers Federation, a bureaucratic trade union organisation active in the same sector. The IDC's structure is found to increase the efficacy of transnational unionism by removing layers of bureaucratic mediation that slow down action, fostering a culture of militant solidarity among participants. Nevertheless, participants noted the heavy personal burdens placed on activists under this model and some difficulties of operating without the assistance of paid professionals. Additionally, differing national legal and political contexts for unionism remain significant barriers to effective internationalism.},

This book argues that despite structural shifts in the economy and in politics, unions retain important functions for capitalist economies as well as for political democracy. Union revitalization in the face of their current difficulties is therefore of fundamental importance. This book charts the strategies unions use to respond to global union decline and to revive their fortunes in five countries \textemdash{} the liberal market economies of the US and the UK; the coordinated economy of Germany and the Mediterranean economies of Italy and Spain \textemdash{} thus providing a wide range of institutional settings, union structures, identities, and union responses. Each chapter provides a comparative analysis of a particular strategy, looking in turn at union organizing, social partnership, political action, organizational restructuring, coalition-building, and international action. It provides a rich source of documentation about union activity, but more importantly it goes beyond description to address two of the big questions in comparative research: How can we explain cross-country differences in union responses to global decline? And how effective are these actions in helping to revitalize national labour movements?},

Differences in the institutional context of industrial relations as well as state policies and employer strategies explain some major differences in how national unions are responding to the current socio-economic challenges. However, our findings reveal that union responses are also influenced by their own internal structures. In particular, we use insights of the social movement literature to highlight the importance of the cognitive or `framing' processes through which unions as actors translate and act upon changes in the environment.},

Labor market segmentation implies priviliges, and these, in turn, provide for class alliances aimed at perpetuating segmentation. Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide. The concepts of equalizing pay differentials, noncompeting groups, and barriers to education are used to show that the nonmanual working class has a strong incentive to form alliance with capital, at least as long as benefits which might derive from different alliances remain unspecified. pg 259-285}

  abstract = {This article examines whether the downward trajectory in strike activity in nine Western European economies has continued over recent years. In doing so, it considers the nature of the dominant forms of extant strike activity and how these relate to systems of collective bargaining and political exchange. The main findings are three-fold. First, while there has been a general decline in aggregate strike activity, this has often been punctuated by sharp peaks. Second, the dominant nature of the strike activity, especially the sharp peaks, has become increasingly concerned with mounting demonstrative collective mobilizations in the political, rather than industrial, arena. Consequently, much strike activity is increasingly being deployed as a tool of political leverage with governments rather than as a tool of industrial leverage with (private sector) employers. Third, official data on strikes are becoming increasingly unreliable as they contain ever more significant exclusions, raising not so much the prospect of an end to quiescence but an over-estimation of the extent of decline.},

It focuses on three types of consequences: political, personal and biographical, and cultural. Political consequences and, in particular, policy outcomes receive most attention, as they are those which have been addresses most often by students of social movements. The review of existing work shows that the field is full of valuable works dealing with this crucial issue and is rapidly growing thanks in particular to a new wave of scholars interested in this topic. Further work should pay more attention to the unintended consequences of social movements, look also at other types of impacts, and carry more comparative analyses.}

Role blurring is associated with higher levels of work-to-family conflict, though the strength of this association is contingent on workers' access and exposure to certain job resources and job demands. Specifically, the association is stronger among workers reporting excessive pressures, and weaker among those with decision-making latitude and some schedule control.},

  abstract = {I test two theories of the political processes of trade unions. The first argues that wage moderation depends on a centralized labor movement. The second contends that, institutional conditions permitting, unions' coordination of bargaining strategies is sufficient. Coordination is most likely to be achieved when there are small number of unions that do not compete for members, that is, when union monopoly is high. Important empirical anomalies may be resolved by analyzing the effects of union centralization and monopoly separately, rather than combining them into a composite index of corporatism. Reanalyzing comparative data from Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries between 1963 and 1985 largely corroborates the hypothesis that monopoly is more important than either centralization or composite indices of corporatism for national economic performance. The conceptual rationale underlying indices of corporatism should be reexamined.}

  abstract = {Ten years ago, when the volume Order and Conflict in Contemporary Capitalism (Goldthorpe 1984) was published, conventional academic wisdom regarding the future of trade unions and corporatism in western Europe was optimistic. As numerous contributors to that earlier volume emphasized, systems of industrial relations involving encompassing unions, in which authority was concentrated in either a small number of large industrial unions or in national confederations, had performed remarkably well in the decade after the first oil price shock of 1973. Most contributors to the Goldthorpe volume shared the view articulated by Peter Lange (1984) that unions could be thought of as playing an n-person prisoner's dilemma in which decentralized action among organizations resulted in collectively suboptimal outcomes. Unions would accept greater wage restraint collectively, the argument went, but not willingly concede acting individually. The prisoner's dilemma analogy suggested that the more encompassing the union movement, the greater the concentration among unions, and the more centralized the authority of the peak associations, the more likely it was that the collectively optimal cooperative solution could be obtained. David Cameron (1984), among others, provided support for this view with evidence showing that corporatism was associated with wage restraint and low strike rates, as well as with lower inflation and less unemployment than in noncorporatist OECD countries.},

When local solidarities are ignored, the weakness of conventional aggregate models is easily misinterpreted as evidence of generic destructuration, and standard postmodernist formulations are accordingly difficult to resist. Although local structuration is often regarded as sociologically trivial, the available evidence suggests that such class analytic processes as closure, exploitation, and collective action emerge more clearly at the level of disaggregate occupations than conventional aggregate classes.}

  abstract = {Since the Webbs published Industrial Democracy at the end of the nineteenth century, the principle that workers have a legitimate voice in decision-making in the world of work \textendash{} in some versions through trade unions, in others at least formally through separate representative structures \textendash{} has become widely accepted in most West European countries. There is now a vast literature on the strengths and weaknesses of such mechanisms, and we review briefly some of the key interpretations of the rise (and fall) of policies and structures for workplace and board-level representation. We also discuss the mainly failed attempts to establish broader processes of economic democracy, which the eclipse of nationally specific mechanisms of class compromise makes again a salient demand. Economic globalization also highlights the need for transnational mechanisms to achieve worker voice (or more radically, control) in the dynamics of capital\textendash labour relations. We therefore examine the role of trade unions in coordinating pressure for a countervailing force at European and global levels, and in the construction of (emergent?) supranational industrial relations. However, many would argue that unions cannot win legitimacy as a democratizing force unless manifestly democratic internally. Therefore we revisit debates on and dilemmas of democracy within trade unions, and examine recent initiatives to enhance democratization.},

However, the increasing number of legal complaints filed by workers with labour ministries and/or the courts in countries like Argentina, Brazil and Chile calls for a more serious debate on the role that trade unions play in this process. This article focuses on the Chilean case. Drawing on various sources, it shows that Chilean unions have turned legal complaints into a weapon to gain more rights and curb employers' power. This process has involved the strongest and most combative unions, and is due to two historical conditions: (1) the obstacles placed in the way of successful resort to more disruptive tactics; (2) the increase in institutional opportunities to report infringements of the law. Overall, the article challenges the current image of the Chilean unions by foregrounding their agency and their achievements over the last decade.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the relationship between political and social democratization in recent democratic transitions by illustrating how the two processes were at odds in the case of labor reform in Chile (1990\textendash 2001). Labor reform served simultaneously to consolidate political democracy and slow down the momentum of social democratization. It was a tool for signalling policy change to legitimate the democratic regime, but at the same time leaving the liberal economy intact. The Chilean case calls into question the thesis of a natural progression from political to social rights prevalent in democratic theory, and allows us to generalize about the way marketization places limits on democratic deepening. The article first discusses what would be appropriate criteria of social democratization considering contemporary labor issues and labor relations in Chile. It then investigates the political process of labor reform. Ongoing legal debates through the 1990s show the extent of path dependence set in motion by the timid nature of the first social reforms in Chile's new demoncracy and their muting effect on citizenship.}

  abstract = {While some scholars suggest that awareness of income inequality is strongest when the actual level of inequality is high, others find that individuals' awareness of income inequality is largely unresponsive to actual inequality. In this article, we argue that individuals in different social class positions often respond to the actual levels of income inequality distinctively, and therefore a class perspective is essential in understanding how actual inequality and people's perceptions of it are associated. Using data from the social inequality modules of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP, 1992, 1999, and 2009) as well as the World Income Inequality Database (https:// www.wider.unu.edu/) and the World Inequality Database (https://wid.world/), we consider how actual inequality interacts with social class to shape people's perceptions of income inequality across 64 country-years between 1992 and 2009. We find that overall, perceptions of inequality are higher among the working class and lower among salariats. However, cross-nationally and over time, as the actual level of inequality increases, working classes become less critical toward inequality, whereas salariats become more critical. The actual level of inequality itself has no impact on people's discontent toward it. This creates a counterbalancing effect that obscures the aggregate relationship between rising inequality and people's perceptions of it.},

Exploiting the longitudinal structure of the data reveals that union membership is best characterized not as a switch, but as a dynamic process involving anticipation effects (which start well before becoming affiliated) and maturation effects (which become noticeable only after a certain duration of membership and may not dissipate after leaving the union). Empirically, the selection effect appears the most important in the two countries we focus on, while the molding effect is less pronounced. Anticipation and maturation effects are also non-negligible and hitherto unexplored.},

Using the WERS2004 linked employer\textendash employee data and alternative econometric estimators it reports an inverse relationship between workplace union density and gender diversity. Gender and ownership status based sub-group analyses suggest the inverse relationship to be stronger for male union members and those in the private sector. Gender group size-based analysis reveals a positive link between workplace union density and gender diversity in workplaces with a female majority. The findings in this paper may mean that unions may need to embrace the changing workplace demography genuinely to improve their fate.},

Comparing regions with such different social, economic, and political systems contributes to our understanding of variation in beliefs about women's opportunity systems. Using a conceptual framework that connects socio-political systems, gender, and attitudes about opportunity, we hypothesize that Eastern Europeans' unique experiences (especially their experiences with communism and post-communism) will result in a very different set of ideas about opportunities for getting ahead than is the case for Western Europeans. We also hypothesize that given the potency of gender in structuring opportunities, the attitudes of women in these regions will be distinct from those of men and that the gender differences will not be the same in Eastern and Western Europe. Our findings provide support for these hypotheses. The East vs. West variable has a significant impact on a majority of the attitude measures. Results show a greater emphasis among East Europeans on the importance of non-individual, structural factors for getting ahead. Gender is also important in affecting attitudes about opportunity but its effect varies across region and across time. Implications for research on mobility systems are discussed.}

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the validity of the `empowerment thesis': the belief that new forms of work organisation are overturning traditional managerial structures and returning control to employees. Specifically, the project seeks to explore the role of `empowering' forms of work organisation (in particular Total Quality Management, team-based work and consultative committees) and of occupational hierarchies, respectively, in influencing levels of employee autonomy. Data from the 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS95) are used to construct quantitative indicators of `empowering' forms of work organisation, hierarchy and employee autonomy. Associations between the variables are measured. The analysis shows no association between `empowerment' and employee autonomy. There are, however, clear relationships between employees' positions within occupational hierarchies and their levels of control over their work. Therefore, the empowerment thesis is rejected. A provisional explanation for the failure of empowerment to enhance employee autonomy can be found in the fact that organisational power resides primarily in organisational structures. Contrary to claims of the emergence of the `post-bureaucratic organisation', hierarchical structures remain central to the majority of contemporary organisations, and the impact of other changes to work organisation must be understood in this context.}

But what ought to count here is not only how society is structured but why it is structured in certain ways and this means grappling with the dynamics of the structure\textemdash agency dialectic. Dowding overestimates the degree to which business is systematically lucky and underestimates the degree to which it is powerful because he fails to recognise the way in which business can shape the structures whose existence allows it to get what it wants without trying. We examine the position of two very different groups: British farmers and US bankers. British farmers were systematically lucky in the post-war years in the sense that they benefited from events outside their control. The US banking sector was lucky in 2008 because it was `too big to fail'. But the banks had previously used their power to shape this outcome.},

Political battles over trade policy appear to have sometimes divided societies along broad class lines and at other times split them into narrow industry-based coalitions. I argue that this diversity stems from historical and cross-national variation in inter-industry factor mobility. Class coalitions are more likely where factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence from six Western economies for the last two centuries indicates that levels of factor mobility have varied historically and cross-nationally in accord with industrialization and regulation. This variation corresponds broadly with observable differences in the formation of trade policy coalitions.},

Very little research has addressed the equally important questions of strike outcomes and trade union membership despite the substantial body of research on the causes of trade union membership decline and strategies for membership growth. In this paper we reverse the usual sequence of trade union membership as a causal factor in the genesis of strikes and examine the impact of strikes on trade union membership levels. After setting out the relevant theory and hypotheses, we use a unique seven-year dataset of trade union membership joiners and leavers from a major British trade union with a substantial record of strike activity. Controlling for other possible determinants of trade union membership, we find that months in which there is strike action, whether national or local, are associated with a significantly higher rate of membership growth, measured both by the number of joiners and by the ratio of joiners to leavers. Data from new union members suggest that perceived injustice and perceived union effectiveness both motivate the decision to join.}

I argue that theoretical and empirical challenges often misread Bourdieu, recasting the theory as a variant of Lloyd Warner's social class theory. I use this evaluation to reformulate the theory to reflect socio-historical circumstances particular to the contemporary United States. In an interpretive study of cultural capital and patterns of taste motivated by this reformulation, briefly summarized here, I find six dimensions of taste that vary across cultural capital resources. Finally, I consider the implications of this interpretation of Bourdieu's theory for survey research concerned with patterns of taste and social reproduction.}

However, there have been few attempts to explain the cross-national along with the temporal variation in the rise of top incomes. Drawing on the World Wealth and Income Database, we study the income share of the top 1\% in current postindustrial democracies from 1960 to 2012. We find that extreme income concentration at the top is a predominantly political phenomenon, not the result of increasing marginal productivity of top managers in markets of increasing size. Top income shares are largely unrelated to economic growth, increased knowledge-intensive production, export competitiveness, financialization and wealth accumulation, though they are related to stock market capitalization. Instead, they are closely associated with political and policy changes such as union density and centralization, secular-right governments, top marginal tax rates and investment in public tertiary education.}

  author = {Iversen, Torben},
  year = {1999},
  publisher = {{Cambridge University Press}},
  address = {{Cambridge}},
  abstract = {This book explores the political and economic couplings between wage bargaining institutions, macro-economic policy regimes, and the welfare state. Based on a game-theoretic equilibrium model, the first part of the study argues that macro-economic performance (especially unemployment) is the outcome of an interaction between the centralization of the wage bargaining system and the character of the monetary policy regime. Thus, in semi-decentralized (industry-based) bargaining systems where the government is credibly committed to a non-accommodating monetary policy rule, strategic foresight dictates that unions and employers observe price-wage restraint compatible with low unemployment. In highly centralized bargaining systems, by contrast, monetary policy flexibility facilitates distributive compromises among unions, and leads to restrained price-wage behavior. Only in decentralized bargaining systems is money is neutral in the sense that policies have no real economic effects. When institutions are mal-aligned \textendash{} centralization coupled with a non-accommodating regime, or semi-decentralization coupled with a flexible regime \textendash{} distributive conflicts and price-wage militancy result in poor economic performance. The argument is supported by econometric evidence from 15 organized market economies over a 21-year period. Pareto-superior institutions are collectively preferred by governments and organized interests, but these institutions are politically contested because the particular institutional setup affects the balance of power between different interests and leads to divergent distributional outcomes in terms of wages, unemployment risks, and welfare benefits. The second part of the study is an analysis of this political contest over institutional design. Modeled as a strategic game between the government and cross-class coalitions of unions and employers, changes in the economic, technological, and political environment alter the balance of power and lead to sectoral realignments and institutional reforms. Specifically, the recent trends away from centralized wage bargaining and full employment policies in highly corporatist countries such as Denmark and Sweden are explained as the outcome of cross-class realignments between strategically located unions and employers triggered by the introduction of new production technologies, economic internationalization, and the fiscal crisis of the state. Aimed at increasing wage flexibility, while simultaneously containing cost pressure, the resulting institutional reforms have been associated with greater wage inequality and a re-orientation of government policies toward the pursuit of low inflation and a more "commodified" system of welfare benefits.},

The authors examine the influence of job flexibility (`standard' versus `non-standard' work) and job instability (changes from one job to another) on employees' willingness to strike. Based on Dutch survey data it is shown that only minor differences exist between `standard' and `non-standard' employees in their willingness to participate in a strike. While this study did not establish a major direct effect of job flexibility on strike participation, tests of interaction effects reveal that job flexibility moderates other mobilizing factors, such as union membership and job dissatisfaction. Job instability, on average, has no effect on strike participation.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONSocial movements have traditionally been defined as organized efforts to bring about social change (cf. Jenkins, 1983; McAdam and Snow, 1997:xviii\textendash xxv; McCarthy and Zald, 1977:1217\textendash 18; Tarrow, 1998:4\textendash 6; Wilson, 1973:3\textendash 4). Yet, as several scholars have noted (Burstein, Einwohner, and Hollander, 1995; Giugni, 1998, 1999; Huberts, 1989; Lofland, 1993:347\textendash 8), whether and how they actually cause social change has received little attention. Social movement research has long focused on questions of emergence and participation. Some attention has been paid to immediate social movements outcomes but scant attention has focused of social movement change. By the latter, we mean the distinctive contribution of social movements to change net of ongoing changes and social processes. Many studies have examined the short-term or immediate outcomes of movements, for example, life course change (Fendrich, 1993; McAdam, 1988), policy enactment (Burstein, 1985; Burstein and Freudenberg, 1978; Costain, 1992), and policy implementation (Button, 1989; Handler, 1978), but few have placed these processes in a multivariate framework and controlled for the relevant societal influences. Most studies of movements have focused inward and have been ``movement-centered'' (Lofland, 1993:289\textendash 91), thus neglecting their possible impact on social change in the broader society. When movement outcomes have been studied, they have typically focused on immediate public policy effects and not the broader institutional and cultural changes central to long-term movement objectives. Understanding social movement change is central to political sociology because the field is defined as the study of social power (see chapter 1). Similarly, social movements are defined as organized efforts to bring about social changes in the distribution of power.},

  abstract = {Resource mobilization theory has recently presented an alternative interpretation of social movements. The review traces the emergence and recent controversies generated by this new perspective. A multifactored model of social movement formation is advanced, emphasizing resources, organization, and political opportunities in addition to traditional discontent hypotheses. The McCarthy-Zald (1973) theory of entrepreneurial mobilization is critically assessed as an interpretation of the social movements of the 1960s-1970s, and the relevance of the Olson (1968) theory of collective action is specified. Group organization is argued to be the major determinant of mobilization potential and patterns. The debate between the Gerlach-Hine (1970) and entrepreneurial theories of social movement organization is traced in terms of historical changes in the social movement sector and the persistence of organizational diversity. A model of social movement politics is outlined, building on Gamson's (1975) theory of strategy and Tilly's (1978) polity theory by emphasizing political alliances and processes shaping success and failure. Piven \& Cloward (1977) are correct that disruptiveness leads to success and that disruptions can be mobilized without formal organization; they are wrong in asserting that formal organization is necessarily incompatible with mobilization. The future development of resource mobilization theory lies in two directions: extending the polity theory to deal with different states and regimes, including the development of neo-corporatism, and providing a more sophisticated social psychology of mobilization.},

Aunando enfoques te\'oricos predominantes y razones pragm\'aticas, cuatro categor\'ias ocupacionales o de clase son usadas (alto y bajo no manual y manual). Modelos de movilidad perfecta y casi-perfecta no ajustan los datos, surgiendo un buen ajuste de un modelo de las esquinas acotado a la esquina no manual en Capital, a la manual en el Area Metropolitana. As\'i, despu\'es de eliminar la inmovilidad de la heredad ocupacional (diagonal principal) y de los "excesos" de movimientos dentro del estrato no manual (Capital), o del manual (Area Metropolitana) -casos donde todav\'ia se dar\'ia la influencia de los padres- se observa movilidad perfecta en el resto del cuadro. Las rigideces habr\'ian cambiado del estrato manual al no manual en los trece a\~nos que van de 1969 a 1982. Los hallazgos tienden a cuestionar las tesis sobre "cierre" o sobre "zonas de amortiguamiento" y a apoyar hip\'otesis sobre invarianza de las pautas de movilidad. /// An intergenerational male occupational mobility table of Buenos Aires City (1982) is analized, and comparisons with a similar one from the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (1969) are introduced. Discussions take place within a context of hypotheses on the invariance of mobility patterns in industrial or industrializing societies, and of hypotheses on the existence of "closure" in the higher levels and/or "buffer-zones" in the middle levels of the occupational or class structure. On the basis of theoretical and pragmatic concerns, four occupational or class categories are used (high and low non manual and manual). Models of perfect and quasi-perfect mobility do not fit the data, so a version of the corners model is considered and it achieves an acceptable fit. If immobility due to occupational inheritance (main diagonal) is excluded and the "excess" short-distance mobility in the nonmanual stratum (Buenos Aires City), or the "excess" short-distance mobility in the manual stratum (Metropolitan Area) are also excluded -situations where father influences still persist-, perfect mobility is observed in the rest of each table. Rigidity found in the manual stratum of 1969 would be present in the nonmanual stratum thirteen years later. Findings tend to question hypotheses on the existence of "closure" or of a "buffer-zone", and to lend support to hypotheses on the invariance of mobility patterns.}

  abstract = {Two quite different approaches to the problem of class formation were examined. Implicit in the first, used primarily by social historians, is the notion that the presence or absence of a predisposition to radicalism is the main determinant of organized working-class behavior. Here, class formation involves the development of revolutionary class consciousness. The second, used primarily by political scientists, employs deductive models to analyze class formation as a routine problem in collective organization. By placing the insights provided by the social history perspective into a rational choice framework, the existence of contrasting modes of class formation is hypothesized. Differences in labor militancy serve as the key intervening variable between more particularistic and more universalistic labor movements. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century aggregate cross-sectional data from 14 capitalist democracies is used to examine the relationship between contemporary labor militancy and particular historical structural conditions. Distinct modes of class formation are the product of specific structural characteristics. Labor movement particularism, as represented by higher strike rates in recent years, is strongest where the lag between democratization and industrialization is minimal and industrialization commenced relatively early,, while greater time between democratization and industrialization and late industrialization are associated with low militancy and solidaristic labor movements.}

  abstract = {One of the most familiar theories about politics in Australia, as in Britain, is that the political parties are divided fundamentally on class lines. But the strength and nature of the link between class and party remains both controversial and unclear. This paper brings new evidence to bear by applying powerful multivariate techniques to national sample survey data from Australia, Britain and the USA. We distinguish three separate aspects of class: the categorical distinction between blue- and white-collar workers which informs the standard definition of class in political science; an occupational status aspect which ranks jobs on a continuum running from low to high; and conflict aspects, based on 'ownership of the means of production', on the 'exercise of authority in the workplace', and the cleavage between public and private employees. We show, first, that these quite distinct aspects of class have different effects. In Australia occupational status has important effects on income and class self-image but is politically irrelevant. The much maligned blue-collar/white-collar distinction is, indeed, financially irrelevant but, none the less, has appreciable effects on class self-image and political preferences, while the conflict aspects have modest but clear effects on income, class self-image and politics. Whether or not an individual is a public employee is consistently important in all three countries. Second, the impact of class on party is relatively modest, albeit cler. Finally, these patterns are quite similar in Australia, Britain and the USA.}

These reference group processes distort perceptions of class: They make most people think they are middle class, thereby weakening the link between objective class and subjective perceptions of class and class conflict, fostering consensual rather than conflictual views of class relations, and attenuating the links between class and politics, particularly in Central European nations. Maximum-likelihood analyses of large, representative national samples from six Western democracies support the argument.}

Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Review of theoretical and empirical literature, including comparative literature. Findings \textendash{} Both strike activity and other forms of collective action have declined in many advanced capitalist countries. There has been a rise in the number of strike ballots and in tribunal claims but these trends do not constitute a straightforward vindication of the displacement hypothesis. However there is evidence of an increase in general strikes in parts of Western Europe and of protest campaigns involving coalitions of unions and civil society organizations. Originality/value \textendash{} The paper tries to summarize the current state of knowledge and to map out directions for future research.},

We observe sizeable increases in market household inequality in most countries. This development appears to have been driven largely, though not exclusively, by changes in employment: in countries with better employment performance, low-earning households benefited relative to high-earning ones; in nations with poor employment performance, low-earning households fared worse. In contrast to widespread rhetoric about the decline of the welfare state, redistribution increased in most countries during this period, as existing social-welfare programs compensated for the rise in market inequality. They did so in proportion to the degree of increase in inequality, producing a very strong positive association between changes in market inequality and changes in redistribution.

  abstract = {Wage setting has been one of the most heavily studied institutions in the field of comparative political economy over the past two decades, and quantitative measures of wage-setting arrangements have played a major role in this research. Yet the proliferation of such measures in recent years presents researchers with a sizable array from which to choose. In addition, some scholars are rather skeptical about the validity and/or reliability of these measures. This article offers a survey and assessment of fifteen wage-setting measures. It attempts to answer questions about (1) how these indicators differ from one another in conceptualization and measurement strategy; (2) which are the most valid and reliable; (3) the strengths and weaknesses of measures of wage centralization versus those of wage coordination; (4) particular countries or time periods for which there are noteworthy discrepancies in scoring; (5) how sensitive empirical findings are to the choice of wage-setting measure.}

We discuss why and how unions seek to mobilize their members and where mobilization is channeled. We argue that union membership affects electoral and collective action outcomes and will be larger for low socioeconomic status individuals. Statistical analyses find that union membership is associated with many forms of political activity, including voting, protesting, association membership, and others. Union effects are larger for less educated individuals, a group that otherwise exhibits low levels of participation. Union membership is not associated with outcomes distant from union political agendas, such as general volunteering and charitable giving, suggesting that unions generate political capital rather than generalized social capital.}

  abstract = {This article examines the relationship between income inequality and collective labor rights, conceptualized as workers' legal and practical ability to engage in collective activity. Although worker organization is central to explaining income inequality in industrialized democracies, worldwide comparative studies have neglected the role of class-based actors. I argue that the repression of labor rights reduces the capacity of worker organizations to effectively challenge income inequality through market and political processes in capitalist societies. Labor rights, however, are unlikely to have uniform effects across regions. This study uses unbalanced panel data for 100 developed and less developed countries from 1985 through 2002. Random- and fixed-effects models find that strong labor rights are tightly linked to lower inequality across a large range of countries, including in the Global South. Interactions between regions and labor rights suggest that the broader context in which class-based actors are embedded shapes worker organizations' ability to reduce inequality. During the period of this study, labor rights were particularly important for mitigating inequality in the West but less so in Eastern Europe.}

  abstract = {This research uses comparative survey data to examine the effects of labor union membership on individual political participation. We argue that national political institutions\textemdash specifically, democracy and corporatism\textemdash shape the ways that unions mobilize their members to engage in the political sphere. Democratic regimes provide structural opportunities and cultural repertoires that lead unions to focus on member mobilization, especially via contentious politics and political parties. Corporatism, which directly links unions to state structures, undercuts the logics and incentives for union mobilization. We draw upon historical cases of Germany, the United States, Chile, and Egypt to illustrate how democracy and corporatism shape unions' mobilization efforts. Multilevel models of World Values Survey data from roughly 60 countries find that union members participate more than non-members across a range of electoral and extra-institutional political acts, such as demonstrating, occupying buildings, signing petitions, party work, and so forth. In democratic societies, such effects are stronger and participation shifts toward parties and contentious politics. In less democratic societies, union members are particularly likely to work with and through other political organizations. Corporatist arrangements generally dampen the political activities of union members.}

A recent study shows that collective protest by organized labor effectively increases social security and welfare spending, whereas mass protest does not have comparable effects on human capital spending in Latin American democracies. This article reexamines the analysis and demonstrates that organized labor alone cannot sway democratic governments. Labor strikes require the synchronizing effect of mass protest to obtain government concessions. Only through concurrent episodes of mass protest can organized labor overcome the numerical disadvantage of pressing democratic government for social welfare spending. In understanding the relationship between labor protests and social welfare spending through the lens of insider-outsider dichotomy, it is critical to consider the synchronizing effect of mass protests. The findings remain robust with alternative measures of democracy and various model specifications.},

This book directly challenges a long-standing intellectual tradition of class analysis, recently revitalized by such prominent scholars as Erik Olin Wright and John Goldthorpe. Insisting on a realist conception of class, Kingston argues that presumed "classes" do not significantly share distinct, life-defining experiences.  Individual chapters assess the extent of class structuration in five dimensions of life: mobility (how demographically cohesive are classes?), interaction patterns (do classes exist as communal groups?), cultural orientation (are there class cultures, as Bourdieu and his followers maintain?), class sentiment (to what extent do objective position and subjective sentiments align?), and political orientations (do classes represent distinct political forces?). This broad assessment is the basis for Kingston's conclusion that classes do not exist in America in any meaningful way.  The Classless Society analyzes prominent general "maps" of the American class structure, as well as the less-studied extremes of socioeconomic position ("Lives of the Rich and Poor"), the alleged emergence of post-industrial classes (the "New Class" and the "McProletariat"), and class structuration in other societies ("American Unexceptionalism").  Kingston rigorously addresses the question, "How would you recognize a class if you saw one?" thus establishing clear grounds for engaging the issue. He relates the findings and methods of the best contemporary research in substantial detail, allowing the reader to assess the book's conclusions from a thorough evidentiary base.},

  abstract = {Why do some protest movements in Latin America succeed in rolling back privatizations while others fail? This article argues that protests against privatizations have tended to succeed under two conditions. First, privatization's opponents form linkages (or ``brokerage'') across multiple sectors of society. Broad coalitions are more likely to achieve their goals, while groups acting alone, such as labor unions, are more easily defeated or ignored by governments. Second, civil rights are protected but political representation is weak. In that case, opponents have the legal right to protest, but are unlikely to have opportunities for communicating their concerns through formal institutions, which prompts them to channel their demands outside of existing political institutions. Using case examples and logistic regression, this study confirms these arguments and discusses the implications for democracy in the region.}

  abstract = {Union density remains very high in Sweden. The significantly raised fees for union unemployment funds in January 2007 were followed by an unprecedented decline in the number of union members in modern Swedish history. In the course of two years union density dropped by 6 percentage points: from 77\% in 2006 to 71\% in 2008. As a result, the density of employers' associations today is much higher than union density. The article below describes and analyzes union decline among different groups of workers and why it was not difficult to foresee this development when the center-right government sharply raised membership contributions to finance the state-subsidized Swedish unemployment insurance. From July 2008 the government more closely linked fund fees to the unemployment rate for each fund, thus differentiating fund fees between different groups of employees. Since the subsequent economic crisis hit private sector blue-collar workers harder than other employees, the differentiation of fees was further widened. As a consequence, total union fees (including fund fees) also varied more by time and between different categories of workers, which in turn was reflected in the development of union density. From 2006 to 2010 blue-collar density fell by 8 percentage points compared to the 4-point decline among white-collar workers. In contrast to the depression of the 1990s, union density did not increase when unemployment increased rapidly from 2008 to 2009. The article also discusses why the government failed to achieve its main goal of changing the financing system of unemployment insurance: to influence wage formation.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to reconstruct the development of industrial relations (IR) in Spain since the democratic transition and analyses the current dilemmas of its social and political actors in the context of the long-lasting economic downturn. Design/methodology/approach Combining a political economy, identifying Spain as a particular variety of modern capitalism, and actor-centred historical institutionalism approach, outlining the formation and strategies of the main social actors, the paper draws on the broad range of research on IR in Spain and its theoretical debates, including proper research in the field. Findings The legacies of the latecomer industrialisation and the semi-peripheral development model still shape the Spanish economy and IR. The impact of the current economic and political-institutional crisis affects the entire institutional IR system and its actors shifting power towards the individual employer thus weakening trade unions, labour rights and collective bargaining. Regarding the theoretical debate on corporatism, the Spanish case provides ambiguous results. The lack of a coherent institutional system and efficient political administration limits the effectiveness of corporatist arrangements and reduces them to contingent concertation strategies. Spain confirms that IR still largely depend on the specific national variety of capitalism that condition economic development and resources for political exchange. Originality/value The paper presents an original, theoretical-informed reconstruction of the Spanish IR and allows an understanding of the current institutional transformations and strategic dilemmas in the light of historical legacies. Additionally, the theoretical debates on neo-corporatism and semi-peripheral development are enriched through its application to the Spanish case.}

  abstract = {Proletarianization in the industrializing economies of East Asia differs significantly from theoretical models derived from early industrialization in the West or semiperipheral development in Latin America or Africa. Contrary to the prediction of the semiproletarianization thesis, dependent capitalist development in South Korea has been accompanied by a swifter, more abrupt, and more intense proletarianization than occurred in 19th and 20th century Europe. The compressed process involves a simultaneous increase in blue-collar and white-collar workers and a rapid feminization of white-collar occupations. Korean workers have not made strong collective responses to proletarianization, largely because of repressive state control of the labor movement and the absence of a strong artisan cultural tradition. But rapid proletarianization has facilitated development of the working-class movement. The specific pattern of Korean industrial transformation and workers' reactions to it have been shaped more strongly by the developmental role of the state than the autonomous activities of capital.}

The "new politics " perspective holds that in the present era of austerity, class-based parties once driving welfare state expansion have been superseded by powerful new interest groups of welfare-state clients capable of largely resisting retrenchment pressures emanating from postindustrial forces. We argue that retrenchment can fruitfully be analyzed as distributive conflict involving a remaking of the early postwar social contract based on the full employment welfare state, a conflict in which partisan politics and welfare-state institutions are likely to matter. Pointing to problems of conceptualization and measurement of the dependent variable in previous research, we bring in new data on the extent of retrenchment in social citizenship rights and show that the long increase in social rights has been turned into a decline and that significant retrenchment has taken place in several countries. Our analyses demonstrate that partisan politics remains significant for retrenchment also when we take account of contextual indictors, such as constitutional veto points, economic factors, and globalization.}

The main hypothesis is that there are contradictory movements. On the one hand, there has been real improvement of various labor market indicators, especially regarding the formalization, falling unemployment and increased of the workers real income. On the other hand, the process of liberalization of labor relations persists, as in the case of outsourcing, the variable compensation and the control of labor day length. It is from that perspective that we discuss the evolution of the labor market in that time period as well as the trends of public regulation of labor via state and via collective bargaining and the role of certain public institutions},

  abstract = {This article addresses an important trend in contemporary income inequality\textemdash a decline in labor's share of national income and a rise in capitalists' profits share. Since the late 1970s, labor's share declined by 6 percent across the U.S. private sector. As I will show, this overall decline was due to a large decline (5 to 14 percent) in construction, manufacturing, and transportation combined with an increase, albeit small (2 to 5 percent), in labor's share within finance and services industries. To explain the overall decline and the diverse trends across industries, I argue that the main factor leading to the decline in labor's share was the erosion in workers' positional power, and this erosion was partly an outcome of class-biased technological change, namely computerization that favored employers over most employees. I combine data from several sources to test for the independent effects of workers' positional power indicators (i.e., unionization, capital concentration, import penetration, and unemployment) and the direct and indirect effects of computer technology on changes in labor's share within 43 nonagricultural private industries and 451 manufacturing industries between 1969 and 2007. Results from error correction models with fixed-effect estimators support the study's arguments.},

We assess whether and why the class-specific impact of self-transcendence and self-enhancement values on attitudes towards redistribution differs across a selection of European countries. The results show that the links between values and attitudes are generally stronger in more materially secure and privileged classes. However, the relative strength of the associations varies substantially across countries. Where inequality is smaller and poverty less prevalent, the link between values and attitudes becomes less class-specific. These findings provide support for our two main interpretations: (a) that welfare policies mitigate the class-specific risks that people are exposed to, which make values more salient and effective among workers; and (b) that the existence of visible and salient redistributive policies works to make clearer the cognitive link between abstract values and support for concrete policies.},

  abstract = {This article uses a classical Marxist framework to study the consciousness and action of inside postal workers in Hamilton, Ontario during and after their participation in the 1987 strike by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). At the time of the strike the Hamilton Local of CUPW was 58 per cent women; the article includes a discussion of the impact of gender processes on women worker's consciousness and action. It also deals with three more general issues. First, through a discussion of conceptual issues and the presentation of a multi-level theoretical model, I offer advice on how to proceed with empirical research on strikes and class consciousness. Second, the "culture of solidarity" portrayal of strikers, as developed by Rick Fantasia, is criticized for presenting an over-integrated view of the participation and consciousness of strikers. I argue that one need not romanticize striking workers in order to be optimistic about the political role of the contemporary working class. This optimism must recognize that in a macro context of politico-economic stability, only a minority of a striking workforce can be expected to experience an expansion of generalized class consciousness. Third, I suggest that Marxist political action in the 1990s should concentrate on the development of generalized class consciousness, especially workers' positive sense of class unity, through the organization of local worker solidarity networks. /// Cet article propose une analyse marxiste classique de la relation entre conscience et action chez les postiers de la ville de Hamilton, Ontario, pendant et apr\&\#xe8;s la gr\&\#xe8;ve men\&\#xe9;e par le Syndicat des postiers du Canada (SPC) en 1987.

In this article, we use survey data from 18 West European countries to examine why classes differ on a central aspect of political preferences, namely their views on the desirability of income inequality. We find that only a moderate proportion of differences between employee classes in support for redistribution can be accounted for by contemporary differences in resources and risks; differences in economic interests to some degree account for the anti-redistributive preferences of the professional middle classes compared with the working class. However, the preferences of the self-employed have a different explanation; autonomy is a better explanation of the right-wing preferences of the self-employed compared with the working class.},

The results show that common-law countries generally have the strongest, and frenchcivillaw countries the weakest, legal protections of investors, with German-and scandinavin-civil-law countries located in the middle. We also find that concentration of ownership of shares in the largest public companies is negativelyrelated to investor protections, consistent with the hypothesis that small, diversified share-holders are unlikely to be important in countries that fail to protect their rights.}

In such jobs, employers frequently try to manage the emotions of their workers, while workers try to control the emotional responses of service recipients. Management techniques for directing and monitoring interactive service workers extend managerial control to aspects of workers' selves usually considered outside of the scope of employer intervention. Bureaucratic controls are also extended beyond the boundaries of the organization through the management of customer behavior. While workers and consumers derive some benefits from the routinization of service interactions, its instrumental approach to human personality and social interaction raises troubling moral issues.}

Past research has documented fairly similar relationships between socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes toward welfare policies. Yet, the nature of these relationships is not well understood. In the paper we argue that the level of support for the welfare state is largely determined by the principles of distributive justice espoused by individuals as well as their images of society. We develop a theoretical framework, which outlines the structural relationship between social attributes, principles of justice, perceived conflict and support for the welfare state. Using data from a recent population survey on the legitimation of inequality, conducted in Israel in 1999 (N = 706), we test a number of hypotheses. For the empirical analysis we use structural equation modeling with multiple indicators. Our findings reveal substantial support for policies aimed at reducing inequality. At the same time we find strong support for rewards according to merit and unequal earnings distribution. The impact of social attributes on attitudes toward the welfare state is partially mediated by the justice principles and images of society.}

The analysis demonstrates that, despite differences in gross mobility between Wright's and Goldthorpe's class schemes, the within-nation fluidity patterns do not differ by class scheme for these three countries. The results based on Wright's and Goldthorpe's class frameworks lead to essentially the same conclusion about across-country differences or similarities in fluidity patterns. The results based on Wright's framework are informative of expected country differences in class impermeability as structured by the three dimensions of property, skill, and authority, whereas those based on Goldthorpe's reveal cross-country variations in barriers as structured by economic and occupational sectors.}

The book consists of aseries of essays treating, among other topics, the definition of orthodox Marxism, the question oflegality and illegality, Rosa Luxemburg as a Marxist, the changing function of Historic Marxism,class consciousness, and the substantiation and consciousness of the Proletariat.Writing in 1968, onthe occasion of the appearance of his collected works, Luk\'acs evaluated the influence of this bookas follows:"For the historical effect of History and Class Consciousness and also for the actualityof the present time one problem is of decisive importance: alienation, which is here treated for thefirst time since Marx as the central question of a revolutionary critique of capitalism, and whosehistorical as well as methodological origins are deeply rooted in Hegelian dialectic. It goeswithout saying that the problem was omnipresent. A few years after History and Class Consciousnesswas published, it was moved into the focus of philosophical discussion by Heidegger in his Being andTime, a place which it maintains to this day largely as a result of the position occupied by Sartreand his followers. The philologic question raised by L. Goldmann, who considered Heidegger's workpartly as a polemic reply to my (admittedly unnamed) work, need not be discussed here. It sufficestoday to say that the problem was in the air, particularly if we analyze its background in detail inorder to clarify its effect, the mixture of Marxist and Existentialist thought processes, whichprevailed especially in France immediately after the Second World War. In this connectionpriorities, influences, and so on are not particularly significant. What is important is that thealienation of man was recognized and appreciated as the central problem of the time in which welive, by bourgeois as well as proletarian, by politically rightist and leftist thinkers. Thus,History and Class Consciousness exerted a profound effect in the circles of the youthfulintelligentsia."George Lichtheim, also in 1968, writes that "...The originality of the early Luk\'acslay in the assertion that the totality of history could be apprehended by adopting a particular'class standpoint': that of the proletariat. Class consciousness ;not indeed the empiricalconsciousness of the actual proletariat, which was hopelessly entangled with the surface aspects ofobjective reality, but an ideal-typical consciousness proper to a class which radically negates theexisting order of reality: that was the formula which had made it possible for the Luk\'acs of 1923 tounify theory and practice."},

Drawing on 18 months of extensive fieldwork conducted at several mining sites in Chile, the article contends that the analysis of precarious workers' organisations needs to consider workers' access to different organisational resources, and the role that political parties' militants play in such access, particularly in the Global South.},

In contrast to much of the treatment accorded such people in the popular media, this research tends to find most of these activists currently liberal on a wide variety of political topics. However, in the absence of panel data, most of this research has had to assess any change in the activists' attitudes either by assuming the activists' past positions or by trusting to their retrospective reports.In this paper we report on panel data from a large group of white activists, mostly students, who spent the summer of 1965 organizing voter registration drives in Southern black communities. In some specific areas on which the activists tended to hold rather extreme positions in 1965, they may have moderated by 1984. However, their overall pattern of response on a wide variety of issues is basically stable over this twenty-year period.}

Recent research, however, argues that previous empirical analyses of this relationship cannot be used to draw causal inferences. This recent work strongly suggests that selection mechanisms confound previous results, and it employs propensity score matching to argue that education has no effect. In this article I show how propensity score matching, as recently applied to this question, introduces bias by creating poorly matched treatment and control groups. I analyze the same data, realigning the treatment with theories of political participation, and I use genetic matching to create balanced treatment and control groups. I then subject the results to a variety of tests, providing a stronger foundation for causal inference. The estimates provide consistent evidence that, contrary to recent results, educational advancement increases political participation.}

Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the author demonstrates a strong effect of participation on the subsequent lives of the volunteers and "no-shows." The volunteers were more politically active throughout the sixties than the no-shows and remain so today. In addition, the volunteers are much less likely to be married and to have significantly lower incomes at present than are the no-shows. Besides reporting these basic findings, the author seeks through path analysis to explore the specific factors and processes that mediate the impact of participation in Freedom Summer on the later lives of the volunteers.}

Workplace and legal studies suggest an expanded use of profiling and significant legal/professional implications for HRM practitioners, yet scant attention has been afforded to the boundaries of such practices. In this study, profiling is framed as a terrain on which employees and employers assert asymmetrical interests. Using survey data from large samples in Australia and the UK, the study investigates the prevalence and outcomes of profiling; the extent to which employees assert a right to privacy versus employer rights to engage in profiling; the extent to which organisations codify profiling practices; and employee responses in protecting online information. The findings contribute to a small and emerging body of evidence addressing how social media conduct at work is reconstituting and reshaping the boundaries between public and private spheres.}

Much less is known, however, about the sources of people's different beliefs. I argue that scholarship is hampered by a lack of consensus regarding the conceptualization and measurement of inequality beliefs, in the absence of an organizing theory. To fill this gap, in this paper, I develop a framework for studying the social basis of people's explanations for inequality. I propose that people observe unequal outcomes and must infer the invisible forces that brought these about, be they meritocratic or structural in nature. In making inferences about the causes of inequality, people draw on lessons from past experience and information about the world, both of which are biased and limited by their background, social networks, and the environments they have been exposed to. Looking at inequality beliefs through this lens allows for an investigation into the kinds of experiences and environments that are particularly salient in shaping people's inferential accounts of inequality. Specifically, I make a case for investigating how socializing institutions such as schools and neighborhoods are ``inferential spaces'' that shape how children and young adults come to learn about their unequal society and their own place in it. I conclude by proposing testable hypotheses and implications for research.}

Drawing on vast data sets and cutting-edge research, he explains the benign and malign forces that make inequality rise and fall within and among nations.

Global Inequality takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared within nations, it has fallen dramatically among nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world.

This chapter presents an in-depth examination of the study of interlocking directorates. I focus initially on both the determinants and the consequences of interlocking directorates, reviewing alternative accounts of both phenomena. Special attention is paid to the processual formulations implied by various interlock analyses. I then address the two primary criticisms of interlock research and evaluate the tenability of these criticisms. I conclude with a discussion of future directions for interlock research.}

Labor-linked parties used labor market regulation to keep labor supporters when facing political uncertainty despite regional convergence toward labor market deregulation. Incumbent labor-linked parties used labor reforms to keep labor allies because their effects were concentrated on formal workers who were already organized and had previous partisan alliances but did not change the preferences of the median voter.}

The authors answer the question by exploring the relationship between trade unions and two of their most important allies: labor-backed parties at home and labor rights activists overseas. While labor-backed parties in Latin America have locked in the support of their core constituencies by adopting relatively union-friendly labor laws in an otherwise uncertain political and economic environment, labor rights activists in the United States have demonstrated their support for their Latin American allies by asking the U.S. government to treat the protection of labor rights as the price of access to the U.S. market. The former trajectory is the norm in traditionally labor-mobilizing polities, where industrialization encouraged the growth of labor-backed parties in the postwar era; the latter is more common in more labor-repressive environments, where vulnerable unions tend to look for allies overseas.},

One large group of corporations emerged based on shared conservative beliefs. No other groups nearly as large were detected. The findings were strong and robust for different levels of political similarity. The identified groups differed from each other economically in various ways, but these differences were not nearly as marked as the political differences. Overall, the evidence lends stronger support to the class rather than the pluralist perspective.}

Through a most similar system design, this analysis shows that the strength and support (or opposition) of organized civil society groups is a crucial condition to account for the enactment (or failure) of a given broad policy reform.}

In fact, many nationalities assume that the structure of their society is considerably less equitable than it really is.

  abstract = {It has long been argued that perceptions of the class structure shape how individuals see their position in society. However, researchers using nationally representative data to study subjective social location rarely include class imagery in their models. This study uses OLS regression of two surveys, conducted 18 months apart following Iceland's 2008 economic collapse, to analyze the effects of class imagery on subjective social location. Results show that respondents who perceive the class structure as inegalitarian report lower subjective social location as compared to those with egalitarian class imagery. The influence of objective class position on subjective social location depends, partly, on class imagery. The study finds that Icelanders saw the class structure become more egalitarian and their own subjective social location climb following the collapse, even as the economic crisis deepened between the two surveys. These findings reflect that income inequality in Iceland dropped sharply after the collapse.},

By answering these questions this paper aims to provide three contributions to social movement literature: first, we want to put networks in their place and not reifying their influence on participation processes; second, we describe and explain variations of networks influence on protest participation; third, to pursue the theoretical reflection initiated by Kitts, McAdam, and Passy on the specification of network effect on contentious participation, that is, to disentangle the different processes at stake.

  abstract = {For decades, analysts believed that the expansion of the service sector would lead to a `middle-class' society. By the late 20th century, class analysts and labour process scholars called into question this argument. They showed that distinctions such as that between `white-collar' and `blue-collar' work failed to capture the dynamics of control and exploitation within production. Nevertheless, in Chile and other parts of Latin America, research still contends that the expansion of employment in private-sector service activities accelerated the consolidation of a `new middle class'. This article challenges this idea. Drawing upon insights from neo-Marxist class analysis and labour process theory, the article compares the perceptions of control over the labour process of workers from different industries, employment sectors and class locations. Quantitative and qualitative evidence suggest that the most important conclusions of recent research are misleading.},

Drawing upon data from 33 countries from the 2015 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), it uses multilevel models to examine how individual perceptions of worker-management conflict are affected by social class, union membership status, and the country-level protection of collective labor rights. The evidence supports the hypothesis that workers and union members perceive more conflict than employers and non-union members. The results also show that, as hypothesized, perceived workplace conflict is lower in countries with stronger protection of workers? collective rights. Finally, contrary to an initial hypothesis, cross-level interactions suggest that in countries where collective rights are more strongly protected, union members perceive more worker-management conflict than non-union members. Contributions to the literature on class and power resources as well as to the recent debate on the ?neoliberal convergence? of industrial relations (IR) systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {At any given point in time the markers of high status appear ``natural''and self-evident, ancient and everlasting. In the following brief historical reading, this article suggests the temporal frailty of such ``everlasting'' status markers. It is not just that fashions change, which they surely do, but beyond such ephemeral changes, the whole intellectual basis on which status markers are established shifts over time, harbingers of changing power relationships in society. This article shows the dynamics of such changes in the United States by tracing the rise and fall of highbrow snobbery as the standard of status honor over the last hundred years, and by setting this system in the context of the systems of status honor which preceded it and the system of cosmopolitan omnivorousness that has followed.}

  abstract = {Collecting data from students within classrooms or schools, and collecting data from students on multiple occasions over time, are two common sampling methods used in educational research that often require multilevel modeling (MLM) data analysis techniques to avoid Type-1 errors. The purpose of this article is to clarify the seven major steps involved in a multilevel analysis: (1) clarifying the research question, (2) choosing the appropriate parameter estimator, (3) assessing the need for MLM, (4) building the level-1 model, (5) building the level-2 model, (6) multilevel effect size reporting, and (7) likelihood ratio model testing. The seven steps are illustrated with both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal MLM example from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) dataset. The goal of this article is to assist applied researchers in conducting and interpreting multilevel analyses and to offer recommendations to guide the reporting of MLM analysis results.},

Collective identity has been treated both too broadly and too narrowly, sometimes applied to too many dynamics, at other times made into a residual category within structuralist, state-centered, and rationalist accounts.},

Over the period 1975\textendash 95, countries that experienced relatively large declines in union density also experienced relatively large increases in earnings inequality. In addition, governments apparently became less willing to engage in `compensatory redistribution' in these countries. Since the early 1990s, however, union decline has become less closely associated with rising earnings inequality and redistributive policy changes. I argue that the declining relevance of unionization has to do with changes in the position of union members in the income distribution. In most OECD countries, the average union member has become relatively better off as union density has declined and union members have probably become less supportive of wage solidarity and redistributive government policies.},

Drawing on a comparison with Franzosi's analysis of strikes in Italy, this article seeks to explain the high number of working days lost in Spain by reference to the role of sectoral bargaining, the instability of corporatist relations, solidaristic features of worker representation and Spanish society, and the development of industrial action by unions outside the main confederations. It is suggested that the pattern of industrial conflict reflects the limited strategic options available to Spanish trade unions and Spanish employers' ambivalence toward industrial relations institutions. The article concludes that although there are reasons to expect a reduction in industrial conflict in Spain, a steady and continuous decline in strikes is improbable.},

A comparison of Alberto Fujimori in Peru and Hugo Ch\&\#xe1;vez in Venezuela demonstrates that contemporary populist figures are associated with widely varying levels of sociopolitical organization. Since popular organization is an instrument to counterbalance elite power resources, greater partisan and civic organization is likely as conflict intensifies between populist leaders and elite opponents.}

This sociopolitical matrix was challenged, however, when hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters took to the streets to protest against educational inequalities, while smaller numbers of protestors mobilized around a plethora of other labor, environmental, and indigenous rights claims. This wave of social protest occurred in a context of growing detachment of Chilean citizens from traditional parties and representative institutions, and it punctured the aura of inevitability and consensus that surrounded the country's economic model. The groundswell of popular protest signified the end of a posttransition political era in Chile and the dawning of a new one defined by the repoliticization of social and economic inequalities, including vigorous debates about the social pillars of the neoliberal model and the reach of social citizenship rights. The Chilean case sheds new light on the processes by which inequalities come to be politicized or depoliticized in different structural, institutional, and ideational contexts.}

  abstract = {In an exploratory study of matched samples in England and the United States, we construct a path model that explains 26\% and 39\%, respectively, of the variance in social judgments about the fairness or unfairness of equality. The underdog principle, from which we predict that egalitarians compared to inegalitarians are more likely to be nonwhite, to have low prestige occupations, to have low family incomes, and to identify with the lower and working classes, is accepted. The principle of enlightenment, from which we predict a positive relationship between education and favorable attitudes toward equality, is accepted for England but not for the United States. The principle of an egalitarian Zeitgeist, from which we predict younger people are more egalitarian than older people, is accepted for the United States but not for England. Two additional important causal variables are found. First, a sense of personal equity, that is, a belief that a person has the standard of living that he/she deserves, reduces egalitarian attitudes in England more than in the United States and may reflect a cultural belief that British society is extraordinarily just because social arrangements result from fair rules of the game. While it is of no importance in England, the cultural belief in monetary success reduces egalitarian attitudes in the United States and functions as the belief in the just society does in England.}

The spread of TNCs, the sharp increase in foreign direct investment, the proliferation of mergers and acquisitions across national borders, the rise of a global financial system, and the increased interlocking of positions within the global corporate structure, are some empirical indicators of the transnational integration of capitalists. The TCC manages global rather than national circuits of accumulation. This gives it an objective class existence and identity spatially and politically in the global system above any local territories and polities. The TCC became politicized from the 1970s into the 1990s and has pursued a class project of capitalist globalization institutionalized in an emergent transnational state apparatus and in a "Third Way" political program. The emergent global capitalist historic bloc is divided over strategic issues of class rule and how to achieve regulatory order in the global economy. Contradictions within the ruling bloc open up new opportunities for emancipatory projects from global labor.}

  abstract = {In recent years, labor studies has flourished even as labor unions in the United States have continued their long-term downward trajectory. One strain of this research has situated the labor movement, and its decline, at the center of economic inequality's rise in the United States. Another has explored the labor movement's interconnections with political dynamics in the contemporary United States, including how labor's demise has reshaped the polity and policies. This body of scholarship also offers insights into recent stirrings of labor resurgence, ranging from the teachers' strikes of 2017 to the Fight for 15 minimum wage initiatives. Yet the field's reliance on official union membership rates as the standard measure of union strength, and on official strike statistics as the standard measure of union activism, prevents it from fully understanding the scope and durability of worker activism in the post-Wagner age.},

I address this question by investigating the effects of capital and trade flows on government welfare spending in fifty-three developing countries. Using an original measure of labor power in developing countries, I test the links between international markets, labor's political strength, and the welfare state. I argue that labor's collective-action problems, caused by large populations of low-skilled and surplus workers, offset labor's potential political gains from globalization. I show that when the proportion of low-skilled workers in a nation is high, globalization will lead to a decline in welfare spending. Most significantly, the results suggest that in nations where labor-market institutions are not yet well developed, government social-welfare spending is constrained by international market. forces]}

Such analyses have gained much popularity in the last two decades but they also come with a variety of challenges, some of which are discussed here. A focus lies on the small-N problem, influential cases (outliers) and the issue of omitted variables at the country level. Summarizing the methodological literature, the paper provides recommendations for applied researchers when possible or otherwise points to the more detailed literature. Some solutions for the small-N problem and omitted variable bias are discussed in detail, recommending the pooling of multiple survey waves to increase statistical power and to allow for the estimation of withincountry effects, thereby controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. All issues are illustrated using an empirical example with data from the European Social Survey. The online appendix provides detailed syntax to adopt the presented procedures to researchers' own data.}

Social scientists are regularly using multilevel models to analyse the data generated by such surveys, investigating variation across both space and time. We show, however, that such models are usually specified erroneously.

These biases occur even if the fixed effects are specified correctly; if the fixed effects are incorrect, erroneous specification of the random effects worsens biases in the coefficients. We illustrate these problems using Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical examples.

Multisectoral associations like the CCE, the CMNH, Coparmex, and COECE are rare in the other large countries of the region. Three primary factors gave Mexican business stronger incentives to invest in these associations. First, Mexican business was excluded from elections, PRI politics, and appointments to top government positions and therefore relied more on associations to channel business's organized participation in politics and policy making. Second, in some periods, government actions were threatening to business interests and prompted defensive organization. Third, in other periods of closer cooperation between business and government, government officials relied heavily on these associations to mediate relations with business, giving big business further incentives to invest in associations.}

Random sampling is not typically a viable approach when the total number of cases to be selected is small. Hence attention to purposive modes of sampling is needed. Yet, while the existing qualitative literature on case selection offers a wide range of suggestions for case selection, most techniques discussed require in-depth familiarity of each case. Seven case selection procedures are considered, each of which facilitates a different strategy for within-case analysis. The case selection procedures considered focus on typical, diverse, extreme, deviant, influential, most similar, and most different cases. For each case selection procedure, quantitative approaches are discussed that meet the goals of the approach, while still requiring information that can reasonably be gathered for a large number of cases.},

This paper analyzes the pattern of Taiwan's proletarianization and examines the demographic and social characteristics of the newly emerged working class in Taiwan. Distinctive features of Taiwan's industrialization are its geographically dispersed pattern of development and the predominance of small-scale enterprises. This has helped the first generation of Taiwan's industrial workers adapt smoothly to industrial work but also has retarded the development of strong worker identity and the working-class movement.}

Theoretically-based hypotheses are sought both in the notion of a 'disciplinary' political business cycle, and in the longstanding body of economic research on the relationship between strike fluctuations and labor market conditions. The empirical findings indicate that the impact of unemployment on industrial conflict varies markedly across countries and subperiods. Overall, strike activity has been dampened by mass unemployment, yet it frequently remains at a higher level than in the full-employment years of the 1960s.},

Eventually, however, both the entrepreneurs' ideological revitalization and the change in economic thought of the majority of the opposition gradually eliminated the various obstacles between both sectors, which facilitated the social agreement needed to achieve the transition to democracy.}

These events ushered in governments in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela that advocated socialization and planning, challenging the consensus over neoliberal hegemony and the weakness of movements to oppose it. Eduardo Silva offers the first comprehensive comparative account of these extraordinary events, arguing that the shift was influenced by favorable political associational space, a reformist orientation to demands, economic crisis, and mechanisms that facilitated horizontal linkages among a wide variety of social movement organizations. His analysis applies Karl Polanyi's theory of the double movement of market society to these events, predicting the dawning of an era more supportive of government intervention in the economy and society.},

Examining the role of BBB in major Canadian labour law reform initiatives between the late 1980s and 2019, this article explores why the labour movement, despite the potential advantages of BBB, has not collectively pursued BBB reforms. It concludes with an analysis of the failure to incorporate BBB proposals into labour legislation and an assessment of the key challenges to adopting significant BBB reforms in the future. Earlier research concluded that BBB proposals in the 1990s failed because of employer opposition and lack of understanding, including by labour. `Ibis study departs from earlier conclusions to find that neither of these factors has been prominent regarding BBB in recent decades. Instead, lack of support for BBB arises from some unions' concerns about preserving existing representation rights, resistance to the prospect of mandatory councils of unions, and anticipation of jurisdictional conflicts. Lack of support for BBB from some peak labour organizations arises from a consensus approach to deciding which labour law reform issues to promote. An additional challenge to its adoption is the politicized nature of labour law reform, and the political cost of innovative and untried proposals deter governments from adopting BBB.}

Returning to theories of class we use Dahrendorf's reading of Marx where three components of classes, the objective, the subjective and political struggle, are used to define the current formation of the working class in China. Class is not defined by status, identity or legal rights, but location in the sphere of production embedded within conflictual capital\textendash labour relations. By engaging with the heated debates on the rise of a new working class in China, we argue that the blending of employment situation and rights in the West with the idea of precarity of migrant workers in China is misleading. Deconstructing the relationship between class and precarity, what we see as an unhappy coupling, is central to the article.},

Special attention is devoted to the non-Marxist concepts of social class advocated by Giddens, Sorokin, and Parkin. Further insights are provided by an analysis of data for 20,000 men in the experienced American civilian labor force. The data are fit with a loglinear model and then further analyzed with multidimensional scaling techniques. The data analysis discloses three broad categories of social class that consist of farmers, manual, and nonmanual occupations. The findings also reveal further subdivisions in which professionals and skilled craft occupations form distinct classes within the nonmanual and manual categories. A third, much smaller, subdivision exists between semi-skilled operatives and unskilled laborers. These findings support neo-Weberian social class concepts. These results are also compared with Breiger's (1981) research on intergenerational mobility. This comparison shows that patterns in career mobility reveal a simpler picture of class structure than the eight class categories that Breiger reports for intergenerational mobility. The conceptual implications of these findings are discussed.}

El crecimiento industrial vinculado a la sustituci\'on de importaciones gener\'o altas tasas de movilidad ocupacional hacia posiciones manuales de alta calificaci\'on. \textquestiondown Hasta qu\`e punto la crisis y el cambio estructural a partir de los ochenta alteraron esta situaci\'on? Partiendo de dos encuestas (1965 y 2000), se identifican tres tendencias: la continuidad en la movilidad estructural ascendente; la reducci\'on de los ingresos laborales en las ocupaciones no manuales; y la permanencia de la inequidad social en el acceso a las oportunidades laborales. Estas tendencias sugieren que los cambios estructurales de las dos \'ultimas d\'ecadas arrojan un saldo negativo en la movilidad ocupacional, incluso en un caso que podr\'ia ser considerado un ejemplo de integraci\'on "exitosa" a las nuevas condiciones econ\'omicas en Am\`erica Latina. /// The author analyses long-term tendencies in occupational mobility in Monterrey. Industrial growth geared towards import substitution fostered high rates in occupational mobility to highly qualified manual labor. To what extent has this situation been modified by the crisis and structural change beginning in the eighties? Drawing data from two surveys (1965 and 2000), the author identifies three different tendencies: continuity in the ascending structural mobility; decreasing pay in non-manual labor; and a persistent social inequality in accessing job opportunities. Theses tendencies suggest that structural changes in the last two decades bear out a negative balance in occupational mobility, even in a case of "successful" incorporation to the new economic environment in Latin America.}

First, it compares working days lost during the past couple of decades in a broad sample of European countries. Denmark, Norway and Sweden are identified as belonging to a `middle' group, while Finland is an outlier. Second, it analyses the number of strikes, which shows enormous differences between the Nordic countries. Possible methodological explanations are considered, but mostly rejected; instead, the causes are located in the historical development of collective bargaining, and in details concerning the peace obligation and local bargaining practices. The recent dramatic fall in working days lost in most other European countries is found also in Finland and Sweden, but not in Denmark and Norway. The research emphasizes factors such as unemployment, workplace reforms and local bargaining. The conclusions are also related to previous findings from the comparative analysis of industrial conflict.},

In the classification of the `Varieties of Capitalism' school, Germany has always been taken as the chief exemplar of a `European', coordinated market economy. The book explores to what extent Germany actually conforms to this description. Its argument is supported by original empirical research on wage-setting and wage structure, the organization of business and labor in business associations and trade unions, social policy, public finance, and corporate governance. From this evidence, this book traces the current liberalization of the post-war economy of democratic capitalism by means of a historical approach to institutional change.},

We pay special attention to business income, which dominates at the top. Our analysis includes not only distributed profits, but also the large proportion of accrued profits retained by firms, which are rarely analyzed given the difficulty of identifying individual owners. Our most conservative top 1 percent income-share estimate is 15 percent\textemdash the fifth highest in the top incomes literature. When distributed profits are adjusted for evasion, the top 1 percent share reaches 22\textendash 26 percent. When we broaden the income concept to include accrued profits, which we impute to taxpayers using ownership shares calculated from business tax forms, the top 1 percent share increases to a minimum of 23 percent. Despite this impressive income concentration, the top 1 percent pays modest average effective income-tax rates of 15\textendash 16 percent.}

It is suggested that diversity can best be understood by reference to a range of quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Consequently, perspectives that treat all call centres as if they were the same hybrids of customization and routinization are rejected, along with over-optimistic interpretations of labour control over work organization. Empirical evidence from nine `workflows' in two call centres - an established financial sector organization and a rapidly growing outsourced operation - provide excellent grounds for an examination of similarity and difference. A picture emerges of workflows which are volume-driven and routinized, involving low levels of employee discretion, and, by contrast, those less dominated by quantitative criteria offering higher levels of operator discretion and an emphasis on the quality of customer service. Despite these distinctions, larger numbers of operators report an experience of work which is driven by quantitative imperatives, most manifest in the pervasive implementation of targets. Targets are also used increasingly to assess and mould the quality of the call centre operator's interaction with the customer. Overall, the evidence casts doubt on the optimistic perspective that call centre work, in time, will come to resemble `knowledge work'.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the impact of class position on collective action by comparing workers' and business' associational organizability. Hypotheses on this are derived from class theory, collective action theory and organization theory. When examining them via a crossnational comparison of labor unions and business interest associations, class-specific differences arise: a higher organizability accrues to business interest associations in terms of the ability to recruit members, but to unions in terms of internalizing interests and making members comply. No theory's hypotheses are completely consistent with these findings. Their shortcomings are discussed, and a revised theoretical approach is developed. The paper's final section discusses some consequences of the observed differences for business' and unions' interest policies.}

The findings of the study reveal that: a) there are surprisingly low levels of support for neoliberal ideas across Europe; b) class (when conceptualized and operationalized more subtly) continues to be a very useful explanatory tool of relative ideological orientation; and c) social and institutional differences between northern and southern Europe are also reflected at the ideological level.}

  abstract = {What looked like carte blanche for corporate-led globalization just a few years ago is now increasingly contested. The brave new vision of market fundamentalism has been challenged on several fronts, from massive demonstrations in Seattle and Genoa to contested trade and environmental summits at Johannesburg and Cancun. The critical insights of highly placed insiders have undermined the dominant neo-liberal ideology and given credence to mounting protests and opposition viewpoints (e.g. Soros 2002; Stiglitz 2002). Economic stagnation, inequality, desperate poverty and violence\textemdash{} whether in Japan, East Asia, Russia, Germany, or the United States and Latin America\textemdash have belied optimistic predictions of the positive effects of unbridled globalization. Economic policy makers from the rich countries are challenged both by domestic opposition and by a growing reluctance in the global South to acquiesce in one-sided trade deals. The future shape of the global economy and its international, as well as national and local economic policies, are now open to wide- spread and growing debate. Yet, debate is clearly not enough. What is also required are strong organized actors to promote alternative viewpoints and to build the progressive coalitions\textemdash global, national, and local\textemdash that can turn policy around. While together they cannot yet match the power of multinational corporations (even if they could act together consistently), many such actors are already present, and many of them are increasingly ready to contest the dominant policies. Opposition forces include a broad range of international and domestic non-governmental organizations (NGOs), from environmental to health and human rights groups, swelling protest movements from global justice, and antiwar to land reform, from Jose-Bove-inspired farmers to religious and cultural defence movements, as well as increasingly independent governments across the global South (from Brazil and Argentina to South Africa, India, and China). And one clearly indispensable actor in present and future reform efforts is organized labour, the subject of this book.},

A comienzos del r\'egimen de Pinochet (1973-1990), los empresarios eran un sector desarticulado, debilitado por el embate del Estado y de los actores sindicales, y traumatizado por las expropiaciones y el alzamiento de la Unidad Popular de Allende (1970 \textendash{} 1973). Tras la revoluci\'on neoliberal del r\'egimen militar, los empresarios se consolidaron como un grupo cohesionado, organizado tras poderosas asociaciones gremiales, y con un proyecto ideol\'ogico com\'un. Su actual riqueza y visibilidad responden no s\'olo a la bonanza econ\'omica de las \'ultimas d\'ecadas, sino tambi\'en a la forma que tom\'o el capitalismo chileno, en que empresas y empresarios gozan de un lugar protag\'onico. La reafirmaci\'on del modelo neoliberal durante los gobiernos de la Concertaci\'on (1990-2010) facilit\'o el florecimiento de este sector, reafirmando su posici\'on dominante. La elecci\'on del empresario Sebasti\'an Pi\~nera como Presidente de la Rep\'ublica en 2010 verific\'o esta tendencia. Este art\'iculo revisa las transformaciones experimentadas por el empresariado chileno en los \'ultimos treinta a\~nos, destacando algunos hitos en la expansi\'on del capitalismo chileno. Tomando como marco anal\'itico las cuatro fuentes de poder social que distingue Michael Mann (1986), revisa rasgos del poder econ\'omico, pol\'itico, coercitivo y simb\'olico que sustentan la posici\'on privilegiada del empresariado en Chile.},

  abstract = {Opposed theories of relations between business and government in advanced capitalist democracies are predicated on contrary assumptions concerning the capacity of the managers and directors of large corporations to act upon their political interests. An assumption of corporate rationality presumes that the corporate elite is largely incapable of identifying and promoting its common political objectives; an assumption of classwide rationality presumes that such a capacity is present. This article examines these and related assumptions about the internal social organization of the corporate elite in the United States and Great Britain. Inclusive and diffusely structured networks of economic and social relations among the largest corporations are found in both countries to provide a foundation for a special segment of the elite whose political interests transcend individual firms and whose internal cohesion facilitates expression of those interests in the political process. This politically dominant segment enters into contact with government in ways that favor promotion of classwide policies and disfavor more parochial outlooks. Challenge to the position of large business, whether from the labor movement in Great Britain or the national government in the United States, is shown to have further consolidated the political capacities of this segment. Though corporate rationality still characterizes much of the internal organization of the corporate community, classwide rationality now characterizes its highest circles.}

The author uses Dreher's (2006) globalization index, which gauges globalization on economic, social, and political dimensions, and Mosley's (2011) FACB rights index, which measures 37 aspects of both practices and laws violations of FACB rights, to examine the impact of globalization on FACB rights of workers. Using panel data for 142 developing countries during the 1985\textendash 2002 period, the author finds mixed evidence of the impact of globalization on FACB rights, controlling for a host of relevant factors, including endogeneity concerns using a System-GMM approach. While social globalization is associated with both strengthening laws and enforcing the laws to protect FACB rights, this is not the case for political globalization. In addition, the positive effect of economic globalization on FACB rights is sensitive to estimation specifications.}

Two analyses are computed, based on similarities of intergenerational mobility inflows and of residential patterns. In both analyses the farm versus nonfarm distinction is the most basic. The second level divides occupations into middle- and working-class clusters. These clusters lend support to a hypothesis of proletarianization of white-collar work; embourgeoisement, manual-nonmanual, middle-mass, and knowledge-technocracy theories are not supported. In both analyses, the majority of clericals and, in the second analysis, technicians are more similar to manual workers than to middle-class occupations. An analysis of friendship choices lends further support to the location of clericals among the working class. The results also document the promise of cluster analysis as a major analytical tool far analyzing social structures.}

Building upon the finding that while voters differ from nonvoters in their demographic attributes, their attitudes as measured by responses to survey questions are not distinctive, we consider a variety of political acts beyond voting that citizens can use to multiply their political input and to communicate more precise messages to policymakers. In addition, we consider not only respondents' demographic characteristics and policy attitudes but also their circumstances of economic deprivation and dependence upon government programs. Although activists are representative of the public at large in terms of their attitudes, they differ substantially in their demographic attributes, economic needs, and the government benefits they receive. Furthermore, in terms of the issues that animate participation, groups differentiated along these lines bring very different policy concerns to their activity.}

The chapter begins by using quantitative evidence to analyse the number and diffusion of social pacts over time and across countries, distinguished by type, scope, and content, before considering the difficulties involved in social pact institutionalization. The chapter compares social pacts with collective labour agreements, considers the differences between dyadic and triadic relationships, and traces the instability of social pacts in part to their discretionary as compared to rules-based character. The chapter presents five key hypotheses\textemdash derived from the functionalist, utilitarian, normative, and power-distributive approaches found in new institutionalist analysis\textemdash as to how, and via what kinds of mechanisms, social pact institutionalization may occur. Finally, the chapter considers why particular combinations of mechanisms are more likely than others.},

  abstract = {The literature on corporatism has presented much evidence associating highly centralized systems of collective bargaining with wage restraint and relatively successful macroeconomic performance. In addition, centralized bargaining is associated with relatively small wage differentials. This paper presents a model of the impact of centralized wage setting on both real wages and relative wages. The central assumption is that the centralization of wage setting at the national level unites unions who are complements in production. Since a wage increase for one group of workers negatively affects the welfare of other workers who are complements in production, centralized wage setters choose wages below the equilibrium of decentralized wage setting. It is also shown that if the union confederation maximizes a utilitarian welfare function with equal weights, centralized wage setting decreases wage dispersion. While low-paid workers clearly gain from centralized bargaining, high-paid workers may prefer that bargaining be decentralized.}

  abstract = {The eight countries examined in this study\textemdash Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden\textemdash have long been viewed as exemplifying ``corporatist'' industrial relations systems, in which union coverage is high, unions are influential and commonly have strong ties to political parties, and collective bargaining is institutionalized and relatively centralized. Many observers have recently argued that such corporatist bargaining institutions are everywhere being undermined by changes in the global economy. The authors, using data from a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, test whether changes in patterns of wage-setting in the private sector are consistent with that claim. Although they find some signs that corporatist wage-setting institutions are in decline, they also find offsetting signs of the resiliency of such institutions. Overall, the evidence does not indicate that wage-setting in the private sector is undergoing a general process of decentralization in these eight countries.}

Several distinct threads have developed, largely in isolation from each other. The authors suggest that the various accounts implicitly rely on different definitions of class politics and propose a way to classify them. The classification is based on two questions: first, whether changes in the strength of the left depend on the working class specifically or on cross-class dynamics and, second, whether emergent class differences in politics are largely spontaneous or constructed. The authors use this classification to assess the prospects for testing the empirical implications of different accounts and point to the more general insights potentially offered by each approach.},

It studies the relationship between income inequality and the development process, understood as the combination of economic, social and political changes produced over time based on the case of Chile between 1850 and 2009. It aims to describe and explain the tendencies in income distribution over time signaling their causes and some of their consequences. In the empirical area, the main contributions of the dissertation are the estimates of historical series of salaries, wages, and different measures of income distribution \textendash{} Gini index, Theil, labor share and the income of the top 1\%. These estimates relied on the methodology of `social tables', which aggregates income earners in categories such as occupation, having estimated the number and earnings for each category every year between 1860 and 1970. In spite of the problems arising from the use of assumptions to obtain an annual estimate, which implies an immeasurable but undoubtedly large margin of error for each year, this methodology allows us to analyze medium-term trends with relative confidence. In the fields of theory and methodology, the paper makes two major contributions. First, it shows the potential of in-depth case studies as a means to analyze the relationship between development and inequality. Second, its focus on the political economy of inequality overcomes the problem of oversimplification. Most studies tend to focus on a single factor \textendash{} usually either on the market or institutions- and analyze the impact on inequality in a timeless or ahistorical manner. But, as this work shows, trends in inequality are always the consequence of a set of factors -economic, social, political and institutional- which interact, so that each one reinforces or overrides the influence of the other. The combination of these factors, which is an outcome of the historical process, is what determines the trends in inequality over time.}

Panel probit, analysis of covariance, and change-score analysis evidence not only the positive impact of autonomy but also the differentiated and gendered relationship between autonomy and subjective well-being measures. Job control, including over tasks and pace of work, increases job and leisure satisfaction. Autonomy over work manner increases leisure and life satisfaction, but only among women. Informal schedule control has positive impacts on job (men and women) and life (men only) satisfaction.},

The article relies on Cohort-based models of social change in concert with a theory linking New Left social movements of the 1960s and 1970s to the diffusion of new life-course patterns. Further, it addresses the question of diffusion across sociodemographic dimensions as cohabitation rates increase. Analyzing retrospective lifecourse data on three cohorts born between 1943 and 1964, I find that later cohorts are much more likely to have cohabited than are earlier cohorts, that left-oriented political activism is a strong predictor of cohabitation for all cohorts, and that there has been some demographic diffusion of cohabitation along the education dimension.}

  abstract = {This study explores a series of predictions concerning the likely changes in the American class structure in the 1970s made by Wright and Singelmann in their work on proletarianization. They argued that, in a period of economic stagnation such as occurred in the 1970s, there should be an acceleration of the process of proletarianization and a decline in the expansion of managerial and semiautonomous employee (or expert) locations in the class structure. These changes should occur both because of an intensification of proletarianization within economic sectors and because of decline in the shift of employment into the relatively less proletarianized sectors such as the state. On the basis of the data used in this study, none of these predictions is supported. Indeed, the evidence indicates a decisive acceleration of the growth of managerial class locations in the 1970s and a clear deproletarianization within and across economic sectors. These findings are interpreted as a result of two principal factors: the internationalization of American class relations during the 1970s and the effect of technological and organizational changes in production on clases in the United States.}

This article argues that the reverse-J curve is itself the result of two distinct kinds of effects of workers' power on capitalists' interests: one, a negative effect, in which workers' power undermines the capacity of capitalists to unilaterally make various kinds of decisions, and the second, a positive effect, in which workers' power helps capitalists solve the various kinds of collective action problems they face.}

  abstract = {I examine the challenges of conceptualization and measurement of structural power when the differential power of industries or individual firms are in question. While ascertaining structural power's operation at this level can be very challenging, I point to some issues of conceptualization and measurement that can enhance our analytic leverage at the initial stages of the research process. Specifically I propose a more refined language of ``structural prominence'' to differentiate between the expected causes of structural power from its hypothesized effects. Using a variety of data I show that researchers have some simple tools at their disposal but must pay careful attention to basic logical inferential limitations when examining structural power arguments. Through an examination of firms' reactions to policy proposals in US securities regulation I find positive evidence for structural power operating in initial policy proposals. When I examine levels of preference attainment in the policymaking process itself, structural power appears to be playing a weaker and more conditional role. I also find that the preference attainment of firms is greatest when structural and instrumental forces operate in conjunction, a finding supportive of recent research in this area.},

Part of this impact is exerted indirectly, through strengthening egalitarian attitudes. Sociodemographic characteristics and conflict perceptions explain the evaluation of current democracy better than they explain general support for a democratic system. The perception of social relations as a ``zerosum'' rather than a ``positive-sum'' game reinforces all of these relations.}

Several empirical studies substantiate the link between macro-level income inequality and political attitudes and behavior, pointing at its broad and negative implications for political equality. Accordingly, these implications are expected to be accentuated in contexts of high inequality, as is the case in Latin America. Despite these general concerns about the consequences of income inequality, few studies have accounted for the importance of individual perceptions of distributive fairness in regard to trust in political institutions. Even less is known about the extent to which distributive fairness perceptions co-vary with objective indicators of inequality. Moreover, the research in this area has traditionally focused on OECD countries, which have lower indexes of inequality than the rest of the world. This study aims at filling this gap by focusing on the relevance of distributive fairness perceptions and macro-level inequality for political trust and on how these two levels interact in Latin American countries. The analyses are based on the Latinobarometer survey 2011, which consists of 18 countries. Multilevel estimations suggest that both dimensions of inequality are negatively associated with political trust but that higher levels of macro-level inequality attenuate rather than increase the strength of the negative association between distributive fairness perceptions and political trust.}
